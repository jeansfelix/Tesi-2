Ser Waymar Royce: to Gared "Do the dead frighten you?"

Lady Catelyn Stark: about Bran "Ten is too young to see such things."
Lord Eddard Stark: "He won't be a boy forever, and winter is coming."

Eddard: to Bran "The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword."
Jon Snow: "Lord Stark? There are five pups, one for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
Eddard: "You will train them yourselves, you will feed them yourselves, and if they die, you will bury them yourselves."

Bran Stark: "What about you?"
Jon: "I'm not a Stark. Get on."
As Jon is heading towards the road, he notices something at the base of a tree and heads towards it.
Robb Stark: "What is it?"
Jon straightens up, holding a sixth direwolf pup, an albino.
Theon Greyjoy: "Ah, the runt of the litter! That one's yours, Snow."

King Robert Baratheon: "Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King."
Tyrion Lannister: "Should I explain the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse to you, brother?"
Ser Jaime Lannister: "You've much to teach me, no doubt, but our sister craves your attention."
Tyrion: "She has odd cravings, our sister."
Jaime: "A family trait."

Viserys Targaryen: to Daenerys "I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all forty thousand men and their horses too, if that's what it took."
Jon: "You're Tyrion Lannister? The Queen's brother?"
Tyrion: "My greatest accomplishment. And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you? Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."
Jon: "Lord Eddard Stark is my father."
Tyrion: "And Lady Stark is not your mother, making you the bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard: never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you."
Jon: "What the hell do you know about being a bastard?"
Tyrion: "All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes."

Jaime: "The things I do for love."
