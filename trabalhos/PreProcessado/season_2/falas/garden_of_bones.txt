Tyrion Lannister: "She's to be your queen! Have you no regard for her honor?"
Joffrey Baratheon: "I'm punishing her!"
Tyrion: "For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit!"
Joffrey: "You can't talk to me like that! The King can do as he likes!"
Tyrion: "The Mad King did as he liked. Has your uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?"
Meryn Trant: "No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard!"
Tyrion: "I am not threatening the King, ser, I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?"
Renly Baratheon: "Can that truly be you?"
Stannis Baratheon: "Who else might it be?"
Renly: "When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?"
Stannis: "My own."
Renly: "I suppose if we use the same one, the battle will be terribly confusing."
Catelyn Stark: "Listen to yourselves! If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber together until you remember you're brothers."
Stannis: "It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me?!"
Catelyn: "We share a common enemy."
Stannis: "The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those who deny that are my foes."
Renly: "The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattles and unborn children deny it in their mothers' wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother, but a man without friends is a man without power."
