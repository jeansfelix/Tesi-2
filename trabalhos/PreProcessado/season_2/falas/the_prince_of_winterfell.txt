Yara Greyjoy: "Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?"
Cersei Lannister: "Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?"
Tyrion Lannister: "Because he has thousands of spies in his employ? Because he knows everything we do before we do it?"
Cersei: "Because he doesn't have a cock."
Tyrion: "Neither do you."
Cersei: "Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking for you."
Tyrion: "It's not that little."
Tyrion: "I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth... and you will know the debt is paid."
Joffrey Baratheon: "They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile, from ear to ear."
Dagmer: "What's this?"
Theon Greyjoy: "Gold...for the farmer. For his...trouble."
Dagmer: "His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now. His wife too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him."
Osha: "Who was that out there...hung from the gates?"
Luwin: "Must have been the farmer's boys."
Osha: "He killed them and burned them....and passed them off as the little lords?"
Luwin: "Shh, shh, shh. They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself."
Osha: "They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough."
