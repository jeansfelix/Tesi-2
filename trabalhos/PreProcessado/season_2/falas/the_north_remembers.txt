Grand Maester Pycelle: "The Raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The Conclave has met, considered reports from maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done at last. The longest summer in living memory."
Varys: "The peasants say a long summer means an even longer winter."
Pycelle: "A common superstition."
Lord Petyr Baelish: "We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer...we'll have fewer peasants."

Tyrion Lannister: "You brought this on yourself."
Cersei Lannister: "I've done nothing."
Tyrion: "Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us."
Cersei: "I tried to stop it."
Tyrion: "Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation."
Cersei: "Robb Stark is a child."
Tyrion: "Who's won every battle he's fought! Do you understand we're losing the war?"
Cersei: "What do you know about warfare?"
Tyrion: "Nothing. But I know people, and I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us."
Cersei: "Joffrey is King."
Tyrion: "Joffrey is King."
Cersei: "You are here to advise him."
Tyrion: "Only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his uncle Jaime back."
Cersei: "How?"
Tyrion: "You love your children. That is your one redeeming quality; that and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children too, and we have two of them."
Cersei: "One."
Tyrion: "One?"
Cersei: "Arya, that little animal, she disappeared."
Tyrion: "Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father would be furious."

Cersei: "I heard a song once, about a boy of modest means, found his way in the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another."
Petyr: "When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when those affections become common knowledge, well that is an awkward situation indeed, especially in a prominent family. Prominent families often forget a simple truth I found."
Cersei: "And which truth is that?"
Petyr: "Knowledge is power."
Cersei: To her guards "Cut his throat. No wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes." The guards obey her every command. "Power is power."

Matthos Seaworth: "And I declare on the honor of my House that my beloved brother Robert left..."
Stannis Baratheon: "He wasn't my beloved brother. I didn't love him. He didn't love me."
Davos Seaworth: "A harmless courtesy, Your Grace."
Stannis: "A lie. Take it out."

Robb Stark: "The King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. He's your bastard son."
Jaime Lannister: "Well, if that's true, Stannis is the rightful King. How convenient for him."
Robb: "My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed."
Jaime: "I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head."
Robb: "Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him and you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the Queen."
Jaime: "You have proof? Or, do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?"
Robb: "I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms."
Jaime: "You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well."
Robb: "No...but he's starting to know me."
Jaime: "Three victories don't make you a conqueror."
Robb: "It's better than three defeats."

Robb: "These are my terms! If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead!"
Alton Lannister: "King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace."
Robb: "Is he?"

Mhaegen: "No, you can't! No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please! Please!"
Janos Slynt: "Enough. Get it done. Kill the bastard!"
Mhaegen: "No, no! Please."
Janos: "Give it here!"
Mhaegen: "No, please! Ahhhhhhhh!"

Tobho Mott: "Gendry! His name is Gendry!"
Janos: "Where is the bastard?"
Tobho: "The Night's Watch! Please, stop!"
Janos: "Where?"
Tobho: "They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north!"
Janos: "How will we know him?"
Tobho: "He's got a bull's head helmet! He made it himself!"
Janos: "Find him."JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:{"url":"http:  slot1.images3.wikia.nocookie.net   am 1472582470 group - wikia photo gallery js","type":"js"},{"url":"http:  slot1.images3.wikia.nocookie.net   am 1472582470 sass background-dynamic%3Dtrue%26background-image%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fimg4.wikia.nocookie.net%252F  cb20150716154804%252Fgameofthrones%252Fimages%252F5%252F50%252FWiki-background%26background-image-height%3D720%26background-image-width%3D1920%26color-body%3D%2523000%26color-body-middle%3D%2523000000%26color-buttons%3D%25231e5467%26color-header%3D%25235f4416%26color-links%3D%252347518e%26color-page%3D%2523d7cbab%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0 extensions wikia WikiaPhotoGallery css gallery.scss","type":"css"},callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init"})
