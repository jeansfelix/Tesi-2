Melisandre: "Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?"
Gendry: "I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench."
Melisandre: "Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up."
Gendry: "I was born in Flea Bottom."
Melisandre: "Your blood is noble."
Gendry: "Are you saying my father, he was some lord or..."
Melisandre: "There." Nods to the Red Keep. "Your father's house."
Gendry: "I'm just a bastard."
Melisandre: "The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood."

Ramsay Snow: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Terrible timing. But I was getting jealous. Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about? Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back. Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?"
Theon Greyjoy: "Please! No! No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!"
Ramsay Snow: "This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations."
Theon Greyjoy: "No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!"

Jaime Lannister: "Sorry about the sapphires."
