<entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> challenges <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade>.
<entidade "Bran">Bran</entidade> tells a ghost story.
In <entidade "Dragonstone">Dragonstone</entidade>,mercy comes from strange quarters.
<entidade "Dany">Dany</entidade> waits to see if she is a conqueror or a liberator.

In the <entidade "Seven Kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</entidade> 
At the <entidade "Twins">Twins</entidade>,the carnage at the <entidade "Red Wedding">Red Wedding</entidade> continues to unfold.
While the <entidade "Northern">Northern</entidade> lords are being slaughtered in the main hall,outside the walls of the castle <entidade "House Frey">House Frey</entidade> soldiers ambush the <entidade "Stark">Stark</entidade> army in its own camp.
What follows is not a battle but a one-sided massacre as the <entidade "Northern">Northern</entidade> army is taken completely by surprise due to the betrayal of their supposed allies.
The betrayers torch all of the camp's tents,with many men burning alive inside of them.
<entidade "Frey">Frey</entidade> men wildly mutilate the dead and dying.
From one of the twin towers of the <entidade "Frey">Frey</entidade> stronghold,<entidade "Roose Bolton">Roose Bolton</entidade> watches the massacre.

<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>'s corpse desecrated,with his direwolf's head sewn in place of his own.
<entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor Clegane</entidade> attempts to slip away amidst the carnage on a horse,along with the unconscious <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya Stark</entidade>,by casually riding away while carrying a <entidade "Frey">Frey</entidade> banner.
Before they can leave,<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> regains consciousness - as she and the <entidade "Hound">Hound</entidade> turn to see a group of <entidade "Frey">Frey</entidade> men shouting as they march through the main gate.
The <entidade "Freys">Freys</entidade> have horrifically desecrated <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb Stark</entidade>'s corpse by decapitating it,then crudely attaching the severed head of his direwolf <entidade "Grey Wind">Grey Wind</entidade> in its place.
<entidade "Drunk">Drunk</entidade> with victory,the <entidade "Freys">Freys</entidade> gleefully parade the mutilated body around the castle on a horse while mockingly chanting King in the North ! 
King in the North ! 
Here he comes,the <entidade "King">King</entidade> in the North !,which is met with by cheers and peals of laughter from the crowds of <entidade "Freys">Frey</entidade> soldiers.
<entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor</entidade> is horrified by the gruesome spectacle,while he holds <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade>,who looks on with a dead stare.
The <entidade "Hound">Hound</entidade> rides away with her,undisturbed thanks to the <entidade "Freys">Frey</entidade> banner in his hand.
In the great hall of the castle the following morning,as servants clean up the pools of blood left by their former wedding guests,<entidade "Lords Walder Frey">Lords Walder Frey</entidade> and <entidade "Roose Bolton">Roose Bolton</entidade> gloat over their victory and the rewards their treachery has won them.
<entidade "Freys">Frey</entidade> will become <entidade "Lord of Riverrun">Lord of Riverrun</entidade>,and the <entidade "Freys">Freys</entidade> will replace the Tullys as the Lannisters' vassals in the <entidade "Riverlands">Riverlands</entidade>.
<entidade "Bolton">Bolton</entidade> has been appointed as the new <entidade "Warden of the North">Warden of the North</entidade>,replacing the <entidade "Starks">Starks</entidade> - though <entidade "Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</entidade> intends to eventually give the position to a future <entidade "Lannister">Lannister</entidade> heir produced by <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</entidade> and <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa Stark</entidade>.
<entidade "Bolton">Bolton</entidade> expresses his concern that <entidade "Brynden Tully">Brynden Tully</entidade> escaped the massacre,but <entidade "Walder">Walder</entidade> dismisses his worries,pointing out that the <entidade "Blackfish">Blackfish</entidade> - and the remaining <entidade "Tully">Tully</entidade> garrison at <entidade "Riverrun">Riverrun</entidade> - is alone and outnumbered against the combined strength of the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade>,<entidade "Boltons">Boltons</entidade>,and <entidade "Freys">Freys</entidade>,although <entidade "Boltons">Bolton</entidade> is still visibly concerned.
<entidade "Boltons">Bolton</entidade> makes plain his contempt for <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb Stark</entidade>,considering the late boy-king arrogant,politically incompetent,and unwilling to take <entidade "Roose Bolton">Roose</entidade>'s advice and make the hard decisions needed to win.
<entidade "Walder">Walder</entidade> questions <entidade "Roose Bolton">Roose</entidade> if he intends to rule the North from Winterfell,and he says that he might move his ruling seat there at some future time,after it is rebuilt.
This leads Walder to ask how <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade> ended up a ruin.
<entidade "Roose Bolton">Roose</entidade> explains that his bastard son <entidade "Ramsay Snow">Ramsay Snow</entidade> offered <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb Stark</entidade>'s terms that the ironborn occupiers would be shown mercy if they handed over <entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon Greyjoy</entidade>,but when they did they learned that <entidade "Ramsay Snow">Ramsay</entidade>,in his father's words,has his own way of doing things ... 
At the <entidade "Dreadfort">Dreadfort</entidade>,<entidade "Ramsay Snow">Ramsay Snow</entidade> eats his breakfast of a thick sausage,taunting Theon about his recent emasculation by pointing to his sewn up and blood-stained trousers,and laughing as <entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon</entidade> finally begs for death as a release from the nightmare.
<entidade "Ramsay Snow">Ramsay</entidade> tells him that he is more valuable alive than dead so the answer must be no.
<entidade "Ramsay Snow">Ramsay</entidade> notes that <entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon</entidade> reeks,and decides that that shall be his new name : Reek.
Theon refuses to acknowledge the name,twice insisting that he is <entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon Greyjoy</entidade>,but after <entidade "Ramsay Snow">Ramsay</entidade> beats him,he finally breaks down and says his name is <entidade "Reek">Reek</entidade>.
â€‹On <entidade "Pyke">Pyke</entidade>,<entidade "Balon Greyjoy">Balon Greyjoy</entidade> reads a message from <entidade "Boltons">Lord Bolton</entidade>'s bastard while his daughter <entidade "Yara Greyjoy">Yara Greyjoy</entidade> cautiously opens a box crudely carved with the <entidade "Greyjoy">Greyjoy</entidade> kraken.
As <entidade "Ramsay Snow">Ramsay</entidade>'s letter explains the box contains <entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon</entidade>'s favorite toy.
The message bluntly says that the ironborn have until the full moon to withdraw from the <entidade "North">North</entidade> or receive more bits and pieces of <entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon</entidade>.
In addition any remaining ironborn will be flayed alive - just as <entidade "Ramsay Snow">Ramsay</entidade> flayed alive <entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon</entidade>'s twenty ironborn followers at <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade> after they surrendered,even though he had promised them safe passage.
It was in fact <entidade "Ramsay Snow">Ramsay Snow</entidade> and his soldiers from <entidade "House Bolton">House Bolton</entidade> who burned <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade> to the ground : he simply sent false reports for his father <entidade "Roose Bolton">Roose</entidade> to deliver to <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb Stark</entidade> which claimed that the ironborn were responsible,as the <entidade "Boltons">Boltons</entidade> were preparing to betray the <entidade "Starks">Starks</entidade> months before the <entidade "Red Wedding">Red Wedding</entidade>.
<entidade "Balon Greyjoy">Balon</entidade> acts indifferent to <entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon</entidade>'s situation since he defied <entidade "Balon Greyjoy">Balon</entidade>'s orders and <entidade "Yara Greyjoy">Yara</entidade>'s common sense when he stayed at <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade>.
Furthermore,he can not further the <entidade "Greyjoy">Greyjoy</entidade> line as the contents of the box prove.
However,<entidade "Yara Greyjoy">Yara</entidade> does not share her father's attitude toward her last living brother.
She announces her intention to take her fastest ship with her fifty best men,sail around <entidade "Westeros">Westeros</entidade>,besiege the <entidade "Dreadfort">Dreadfort</entidade>,and liberate <entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon</entidade>.
In the <entidade "Riverlands">Riverlands</entidade>,a despondent <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya Stark</entidade> and <entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor Clegane</entidade> ride away from the outskirts of the <entidade "Twins">Twins</entidade>.
They pass close to a small group of <entidade "Freys">Frey</entidade> men,one of whom is bragging about being one of the men who cut off <entidade "Grey Wind">Grey Wind</entidade>'s head and attached it to <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb Stark</entidade>'s body.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> approaches them and sweetly asks to warm herself by the fire.
She offers the coin given to her by <entidade "Jaqen H'ghar">Jaqen H'ghar</entidade> as payment.
When the <entidade "Freys">Frey</entidade> man investigates,she stabs him in the neck.
Slightly thrown,the <entidade "Hound">Hound</entidade> deals with the others before demanding to know where <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> got the knife.
She reveals it's his.
He admonishes her to let him know the next time she plans to do something like that.
As he grumbles and cleans up the bodies,<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> whispers,valar morghulis.
Meanwhile,in <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade>,<entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</entidade> and <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa Stark</entidade> walk through the gardens.
A pair of passing gentlemen snigger at <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade>,either for his dwarf status or due to rumors he has not consummated his marriage.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> tells him to pay them no mind.
<entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> reminds <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> that he's used to it,as he's always been a dwarf.
He also states that he's not <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade>,<entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> would rather bide his time and humiliate them.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> playfully follows his line of thinking,and suggests sheep-shifting- secretly hiding sheep's dung deep within a mattress ( as <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> used to do to her ),so that the target always wakes up smelling of dung.
Tyrion is amused but is confused by the term,though he realizes belatedly that <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> has misheard the word shit.
He is rescued from having to explain his wife's mistake by <entidade "Podrick Payne">Podrick Payne</entidade>,who calls him to a meeting of the <entidade "Small Council">Small Council</entidade>.
In <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade>'s chambers <entidade "Pycelle">Grand Maester Pycelle</entidade> dithers over giving <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> a coded message from <entidade "Freys">Lord Frey</entidade>.
<entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> jubilantly explains its meaning that <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade> and <entidade "Catelyn Stark">Catelyn Stark</entidade> are both dead.
Tyrion is visibly startled by the news,already foreseeing the long-term problems that the incident will cause,but <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> brushes him off and gleefully states that he intends to serve <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade>'s severed head to <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> at his wedding feast.
None of the <entidade "Small Council">Small Council</entidade> are able to mask how distasteful they find the concept.
<entidade "Varys">Varys</entidade> points out that <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> is <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade>'s aunt by marriage now ( and it would be unseemly not to give her the basic respect that accords ).
A deeply embarrassed <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> forces a smile and insists to the rest of the council that <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> was only joking and did not mean it.
This puzzles <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade>,who matter-of-factly states to his mother that he did mean it,and he will have <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade>'s head served at his wedding feast.
<entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> flatly forbids it and tells Joffrey that Sansa isn't his to torment anymore.
<entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> angrily proclaims that he is the king,and everyone is his to torment.
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> counters that a king who has to remind his subjects that he is the king,is no king.
<entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> goes apoplectic and tries to fight his grandfather,deriding <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> as a coward who hid under Casterly Rock while Joffrey's father <entidade "King Robert">King Robert</entidade> won the real war when he overthrew the <entidade "Targaryens">Targaryens</entidade>.
The entire <entidade "Small Council">Small Council</entidade> tenses waiting for <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> to respond to this shocking insult : instead <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> coldly and calmly declares that the king is tired and advises the <entidade "Regent">Queen Regent</entidade> to see him to bed.
<entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> weakly protests that he is not tired but leaves with his mother,and <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> also asks <entidade "Pycelle">Pycelle</entidade> to give his grandson a sedative to make sure he goes to sleep.
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> dismisses the rest of the council,save <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade>,who drily notes that the <entidade "Lord of the Seven Kingdoms">Lord of the Seven Kingdoms</entidade> has been sent to bed without his supper.
He confronts Tywin about his part in the <entidade "Red Wedding">Red Wedding</entidade>,and deduces that his father must have orchestrated it,as <entidade "Walder Frey">Walder Frey</entidade> is not brave enough to have carried it out on his own.
The <entidade "Hand">Hand</entidade> blithely confirms this.
He dismisses <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade>'s concerns that the <entidade "Northerners">Northerners</entidade> will never forget nor forgive such an outrage,arguing he wants them to remember so that it will make them wary of rebelling again.
Tyrion shows his distaste for <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade>'s choice of a wedding as the place to inflict the slaughter,but <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> responds,asking why killing ten thousand soldiers in battle is nobler than killing a dozen guests at a wedding.
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> again waxes poetic about family,noting <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade>'s failure to consummate his marriage to <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade>.
Tyrion refuses to force himself on <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> to do his duty,and notes that she is hardly likely to warm to him now that the Lannisters have murdered her mother and brother.
Tyrion demands to know when <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> ever put the family's interests above his own.
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> retorts that he did exactly that on the day that <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> was born : he wanted to throw his newborn son into the sea,but instead he spared him and raised him as his son,because he is a <entidade "Lannister">Lannister</entidade>.
Immediately after leaving,<entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> returns to his chambers and calls for <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade>,who simply regards him with a forlorn,tear-streaked face confirming that she was already informed of her family's death.
Tyrion backs out,knowing that his sympathy would be rather cold comfort.
Elsewhere in the <entidade "Red Keep">Red Keep</entidade>,<entidade "Varys">Varys</entidade> meets with <entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade>.
He tells her that he knows she is genuinely in love with <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> - and that is why she should take the diamonds he offers her and leave immediately for <entidade "Essos">Essos</entidade> to build a new,lavish life for herself.
<entidade "Varys">Varys</entidade> is convinced that <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> is the last hope for the <entidade "Seven Kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</entidade>' current regime,therefore <entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade> is a weakness that <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade>,and thus the realm,can not afford.
Shae confirms that she is in love with <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> and that she cares deeply for <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> as well,but in spite of her pain at seeing them together and the danger she poses,<entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade> will not leave until or unless <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> asks her to.
Unknown to everyone in <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade>,<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</entidade>,<entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne of Tarth</entidade>,and <entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> finally arrive ; the city folk do not even recognize <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> after his long absence from the capital.
They make their way to the <entidade "Red Keep">Red Keep</entidade>,where <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> immediately calls on <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade>,who regards him with a confused look as she takes in his disheveled appearance and missing hand.
At <entidade "Dragonstone">Dragonstone</entidade>,<entidade "Davos Seaworth">Ser Davos Seaworth</entidade> tests his new-found literacy on <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</entidade>'s correspondence,declining <entidade "Shireen Baratheon">Shireen Baratheon</entidade>'s invitation to read more tales of <entidade "Aegon">Aegon</entidade> I <entidade "Targaryens">Targaryen</entidade>.
He expresses dissatisfaction about the odd spelling of the word night,before hearing the horns that signal <entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade>'s intents to sacrifice <entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade>.
He argues with <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> again about sacrificing the boy,but <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> is convinced by <entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> that using <entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade> as part of her blood magic will give him the power to destroy his enemies and claim the <entidade "Iron Throne">Iron Throne</entidade>.
When he doesn't get through to his liege,<entidade "Davos Seaworth">Davos</entidade> takes matters into his own hands and frees the boy,giving him a rowboat and directions to <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade>.
A furious <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> sentences <entidade "Davos Seaworth">Davos</entidade> to death but the <entidade "Onion Knight">Onion Knight</entidade> produces a letter from the <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade>.
<entidade "Davos Seaworth">Davos</entidade> insists that it is <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade>' duty to assist the black brothers,and that he will need <entidade "Davos Seaworth">Davos</entidade>'s assistance to rally troops and mercenaries.
<entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> burns the letter and acknowledges the truth : the <entidade "War of the Five Kings">War of the Five Kings</entidade> is irrelevant.
The true war lies in the <entidade "Northerners">North</entidade>,and evil and death are marching on the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade>.
She also agrees that <entidade "Davos Seaworth">Davos</entidade> has an important role to play in the events to come.
<entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> sarcastically laughs at <entidade "R'hllor">R'hllor</entidade>'s sense of humor,noting that the god <entidade "Davos Seaworth">Davos</entidade> likes to mock has chosen him for a higher purpose.

At the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> 
Arriving at the abandoned <entidade "Nightfort">Nightfort</entidade>,<entidade "Meera Reed">Meera Reed</entidade> tells <entidade "Bran">Bran</entidade>,<entidade "Hodor">Hodor</entidade> and <entidade "Jojen">Jojen</entidade> that the castle is safe to enter.
While around the fire <entidade "Bran">Bran</entidade> tells the story of the <entidade "Rat Cook">Rat Cook</entidade>,a <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade> member who killed a guest under his roof,a sin the gods can not forgive.
Later that night,<entidade "Bran">Bran</entidade> is awoken by a sound,and wakes his companions in time to see something large climbing out of the castle well ; <entidade "Meera Reed">Meera</entidade> attacks and overpowers the intruder,who is revealed to be <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Samwell Tarly</entidade>,accompanied by <entidade "Gilly">Gilly</entidade>.
<entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> quickly deduces <entidade "Bran">Bran</entidade>'s identity by recognizing <entidade "Bran">Bran</entidade>'s direwolf and <entidade "Hodor">Hodor</entidade>.
<entidade "Bran">Bran</entidade> asks <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> to take him and his group north of the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade>,and though <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> protests the idea,given the threat of the <entidade "White">White</entidade> <entidade "Walkers">Walkers</entidade> and the undead horde they command approaching,he eventually relents and takes them through the passage.
Before they separate <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> gives the group the rest of his dragonglass supply and tells them that it has the power to kill <entidade "White">White</entidade> <entidade "Walkers">Walkers</entidade>.
The groups then head in different directions ; <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> and Gilly for Castle Black,and the <entidade "Reeds">Reeds</entidade>,<entidade "Hodor">Hodor</entidade>,and Bran beyond the Wall.
At <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade>,<entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> and <entidade "Gilly">Gilly</entidade> meet with <entidade "Aemon">Maester Aemon</entidade>,who is furious at the prospect of <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> having violated his vows.
<entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> defends himself by reciting the <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade> oath to protect the realms of men whatever side of the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> they are on and repeating <entidade "Jeor Mormont">Jeor Mormont</entidade>'s assertion that a wall of ice 500 miles long and 700 feet high was not built to keep out barbarians.
<entidade "Aemon">Aemon</entidade>'s demeanor softens upon learning that <entidade "Gilly">Gilly</entidade> was one of <entidade "Craster">Craster</entidade>'s wives,and acknowledges that she is now a refugee and should be sheltered.
<entidade "Aemon">Aemon</entidade> then orders <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> to begin writing letters immediately and make sure that all forty-four of <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade>'s ravens are well-fed,as every one of them is to fly that night : the <entidade "White">White</entidade> <entidade "Walkers">Walkers</entidade> have returned,and <entidade "Westeros">Westeros</entidade> must be warned.
Stopping to rest and tend to his injuries after fleeing the wildlings,<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Snow</entidade> finds himself confronted by a furious <entidade "Ygritte">Ygritte</entidade>,who has an arrow ready to shoot him.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> tries to talk <entidade "Ygritte">Ygritte</entidade> out of shooting him,insisting that he still loves her but that she should have known his loyalty to the <entidade "Watch">Watch</entidade> was never gone.
Though his feelings are clearly reciprocated,<entidade "Ygritte">Ygritte</entidade> is still angered by his betrayal and shoots <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> three times with her bow as he flees from her,watching him go with tears in her eyes.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> is badly injured,but his horse manages to carry him the rest of the way to <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade>,as he hovers in and out of consciousness.
Having reached safety,<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> is brought inside the castle by the guards,where he encounters <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> and <entidade "Pypar">Pypar</entidade>,who are overjoyed to see him and insist that his injuries be taken care of.

Across the <entidade "Narrow Sea">Narrow Sea</entidade> 
Outside the walls of <entidade "Yunkai">Yunkai</entidade>,<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> and her advisors wait for the city's slaves to appear.
<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> frets that the Yunkish slaves,who are better treated than <entidade "Astapor">Astapor</entidade>'s might have grown to like their chains and will not welcome freedom.
Finally,the gates open and the freedmen pour out.
<entidade "Missandei">Missandei</entidade> begins to tell them of how <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> the <entidade "Unburnt">Unburnt</entidade> freed them,but <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> interrupts and says that it is the slaves' own choice to reach for their freedom.
After a moment,one of the freedmen stretches his hand towards <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> and calls out mhysa.
After a moment,another follows suit,then another and another until the entire crowd is chanting mhysa.
<entidade "Bewildered">Bewildered</entidade>,<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> turns to <entidade "Missandei">Missandei</entidade>,who reveals that the word means mother in the <entidade "Old Ghiscari">Old Ghiscari</entidade> language.
When the slaves advance on <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade>,the <entidade "Unsullied">Unsullied</entidade> step into formation,but the queen tells them to stand down.
Telling her dragons to fly,<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> steps out of the protection of the <entidade "Unsullied">Unsullied</entidade> and into the crowd,who carry on their chanting.
<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> is embraced by the former slaves,offering a glimmer of hope in an increasingly darker and hopeless world.
