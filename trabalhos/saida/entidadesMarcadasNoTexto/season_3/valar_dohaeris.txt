Beyond the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> 
Ghost attacks a wight 
In a prologue scene,shouts and sword clashes are heard in the darkness as the <entidade " White"> White</entidade> <entidade " Walkers"> Walkers</entidade> and their army of undead wights attack the men of the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> off-screen in the <entidade " Battle of the Fist of the First Men"> Battle of the Fist of the First Men</entidade>.
<entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Samwell Tarly</entidade> is then seen alive,wandering through a blizzard in search of safety.
He sees another man of the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> up ahead but soon finds that he has been decapitated and his head placed in his own hands.
Just then,a wight approaches <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> and is about to attack him with an axe when the direwolf <entidade " Ghost"> Ghost</entidade> knocks it down.
Ghost continues to tear at its legs as it pulls itself forward inch by inch towards <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade>.
The wight suddenly burst into flame,destroyed by a torch wielded by <entidade " Lord Commander Jeor Mormont"> Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</entidade>,killing it.
<entidade " Mormont"> Mormont</entidade> has managed to rally the few dozen survivors out of his original three hundred men at the <entidade " Fist of the First Men"> Fist of the First Men</entidade>.
<entidade " Mormont"> Mormont</entidade> is angry that <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> wasn't able to send off any messenger-ravens in the confusion of the attack.
<entidade " Mormont"> Mormont</entidade> announces that they must retreat back to the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade>,not simply to save their own lives but because <entidade " Castle Black"> Castle Black</entidade> and the rest of <entidade " Westeros"> Westeros</entidade> must be warned of the coming threatâ€•otherwise everyone they've ever known will die.
Meanwhile,<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon Snow</entidade> is led by <entidade " Ygritte"> Ygritte</entidade> and the <entidade " Lord of Bones"> Lord of Bones</entidade> into the main wildling camp in the <entidade " Frostfangs"> Frostfangs</entidade> mountains.
It is not simply an army camp - almost all of wildling society is on the move to escape the <entidade " White"> White</entidade> <entidade " Walkers"> Walkers</entidade>,including women and children.
As they enter the camp,<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> is shocked to see a real-life giant walk past.
Many of the wildlings are surprised to see <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> in his all-black <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> clothing and shout Crow ! 
at his approach.
Several young boys pelt <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> with ice and small stones,but <entidade " Ygritte"> Ygritte</entidade> shoos them away.

Giant carrying mammoth bones 
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> is led into the tent of <entidade " King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder"> King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder</entidade>,where the <entidade " Lord of Bones"> Lord of Bones</entidade> explains that he is <entidade " Ned Stark"> Ned Stark</entidade>'s bastard son to a large man with a heavy beard who is eating chicken by the fire.
He says that he doesn't care,but his interest is piqued on hearing that <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> killed <entidade " Qhorin Halfhand"> Qhorin Halfhand</entidade>.
As they talk,<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> kneels before the man,whom he assumes to be <entidade " Mance Rayder"> Mance Rayder</entidade>,and calls him Your Grace as he would a king south of the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade>.
All the wildlings to burst into laughter ; their society does not bother with such ceremony and because the man actually isn't <entidade " Mance Rayder"> Mance</entidade>,but his lieutenant <entidade " Tormund Giantsbane"> Tormund Giantsbane</entidade>.
Mance himself is an unassuming man sitting in a corner,who then introduces himself and tells <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> to stand,as no man kneels before another among the <entidade " Free Folk"> Free Folk</entidade>,as they do not recognize a class of nobility in their culture.
<entidade " Mance Rayder"> Mance</entidade> says he is glad that <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> killed <entidade " Qhorin Halfhand"> Qhorin</entidade>,as he had killed many of <entidade " Mance Rayder"> Mance</entidade>'s wildlings,though he notes that <entidade " Qhorin Halfhand"> Qhorin</entidade> was his brother once,back when he was a member of the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> and <entidade " Qhorin Halfhand"> Qhorin</entidade> had a whole hand.
Mance asks <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> why he wants to join them.
He replies that he wants to be free,but <entidade " Mance Rayder"> Mance</entidade> thinks he just wants to be a hero.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> then explains that when the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> camped at <entidade " Craster's Keep"> Craster's Keep</entidade>,he saw <entidade " Craster's Keep"> Craster</entidade> leave his newborn son in the woods as an offering,and the inhuman creature that took it.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> says that he wants to leave the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> because he is disgusted that <entidade " Mormont"> Mormont</entidade> already knew what <entidade " Craster's Keep"> Craster</entidade> was doing but did nothing to stop it.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> states that the <entidade " First Men"> First Men</entidade> he is descended from defeated the <entidade " White"> White</entidade> <entidade " Walkers"> Walkers</entidade> once during The <entidade " Long Night"> Long Night</entidade>,and that now he wants to fight for the side who fights for the living.
Mance is satisfied and advises <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> to get a new cloak.

In the <entidade " Seven Kingdoms"> Seven Kingdoms</entidade> 
<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> confronts two <entidade " Kingsguard"> Kingsguard</entidade> 
In <entidade " King's Landing"> King's Landing</entidade>,<entidade " King Joffrey Baratheon"> King Joffrey Baratheon</entidade>'s forces stand victorious after the <entidade " Battle of the Blackwater"> Battle of the Blackwater</entidade>.
<entidade " House Lannister"> House Lannister</entidade>'s new allies <entidade " House Tyrell"> House Tyrell</entidade> begin to settle into the capital.
<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin Lannister</entidade> bluntly tells his son Tyrion that he intends to disinherit him.
This comes as a shock,because his older brother <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> gave up all right to inherit his father's lands when he joined the <entidade " Kingsguard"> Kingsguard</entidade>,and <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> is rightfully the next in line of succession.
For that matter,despite all evidence to the contrary,<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> refuses to believe that <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> was in any way helpful in the defense of the city or during his months as acting <entidade " Hand of the King"> Hand of the King</entidade>.
Instead,<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> obstinately maintains his belief that <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> is a whore-mongering,drunken,ill-made,spiteful little creature,and that he is lying about all of his accomplishments out of envy.
<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> is particularly insulted that <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> brought his mistress,<entidade " Shae"> Shae</entidade>,to the capital when <entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> explicitly told him not to,which makes <entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> convince himself that <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> was in bed with <entidade " Shae"> Shae</entidade> most of the time while events spiraled out of control.
When <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> asks why his father is doing this,<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> is shocked as if <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> insulted him,and says it should be obvious as Tyrion killed his mother <entidade " Joanna"> Joanna</entidade> in childbirth so that he might enter the world.
<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> says that the laws of men say he has to let <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> use his family name,but that he wishes he could prove <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> wasn't his son,so his very existence would not continue to make a mockery out of the name <entidade " Lannister"> Lannister</entidade> which he stole from <entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade>.
Tyrion fumes at the situation to his sellsword <entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade>,who has recently been knighted as a reward for his service in the <entidade " Battle of the Blackwater"> Battle of the Blackwater</entidade>.
He now styles himself as <entidade " Ser Bronn of the Blackwater"> Ser Bronn of the Blackwater</entidade>,and while possessing no lands,wealth,or title,this drastically elevates his social standing and in his mind,his pay.
Meanwhile,<entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade>'s ride back from the <entidade " Great Sept of Baelor"> Great Sept of Baelor</entidade> in a heavily guarded palanquin is interrupted when his betrothed,<entidade " Lady Margaery Tyrell"> Lady Margaery Tyrell</entidade>,stops the procession in <entidade " Flea Bottom"> Flea Bottom</entidade> unexpectedly.
Margaery shocks the guards and bewilders <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> by getting out and exploring,eventually arriving at an orphanage and interacting with the children.
Meanwhile,her servants pass out bread and toys,earning her the love of <entidade " Flea Bottom"> Flea Bottom</entidade>'s smallfolk.
That evening,<entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> and <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> visit <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> and her brother <entidade " Loras Tyrell"> Loras Tyrell</entidade> for a small dinner party.
<entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> admonishes <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade>'s boldness and reminds her that her impromptu charity work took place on the same streets where the royal party was assaulted weeks earlier.
When <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> naively defends <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> and criticizes his mother,<entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> realizes that she is on the verge of being outmaneuvered.
<entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> only knows how to rule through fear,but <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> knows how to win the love of the people she rules over,a skill <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> lacks.
<entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa Stark</entidade> and <entidade " Shae"> Shae</entidade> sit on the docks watching ships arrive and depart.
Sansa wants to play a game making up stories about where the ships are headed,but <entidade " Shae"> Shae</entidade>,in typical fashion,is uninterested.
<entidade " Petyr Baelish"> Petyr Baelish</entidade> arrives to speak with <entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade>.
She displays an eagerness to leave as soon as possible.
He suggests that when he next leaves the capital by sea,she might be able to stow away.
<entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade> advises him not to give her too many details since she is a terrible liar.
Meanwhile,<entidade " Ros"> Ros</entidade>,who seems to be acting as <entidade " Littlefinger"> Littlefinger</entidade>'s aide,reminisces about the day <entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade> was born,when all the bells in <entidade " Winterfell"> Winterfell</entidade> were rung in celebration.
She asks <entidade " Shae"> Shae</entidade> to look out for <entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade>,particularly in regards to <entidade " Littlefinger"> Littlefinger</entidade>.
On <entidade " Dragonstone"> Dragonstone</entidade>,<entidade " King Stannis Baratheon"> King Stannis Baratheon</entidade>'s shattered forces regroup after being almost totally destroyed in the <entidade " Battle of the Blackwater"> Battle of the Blackwater</entidade>.
<entidade " Davos Seaworth"> Davos Seaworth</entidade> is rescued from the sea by <entidade " Salladhor Saan"> Salladhor Saan</entidade> after being thrown overboard by the wildfire blast in the battle.
<entidade " Forlorn"> Forlorn</entidade> over the death of his son <entidade " Matthos"> Matthos</entidade>,<entidade " Davos Seaworth"> Davos</entidade> feels that <entidade " Melisandre"> Melisandre</entidade> has led <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade> to disaster,and is horrified to hear from Salladhor that she has begun to conduct human sacrifices.
After the defeated remnant of <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade>' forces returned to the island,<entidade " Melisandre"> Melisandre</entidade> ordered any who spoke out against her to be burned alive as offerings to the <entidade " Lord of Light"> Lord of Light</entidade>.
<entidade " Davos Seaworth"> Davos</entidade> convinces <entidade " Salladhor Saan"> Salladhor</entidade> to bring him to <entidade " Dragonstone"> Dragonstone</entidade>.
He finds <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade> despondent,sitting in the <entidade " Chamber of the Painted Table"> Chamber of the Painted Table</entidade> alone with <entidade " Melisandre"> Melisandre</entidade>.
<entidade " Davos Seaworth"> Davos</entidade> openly calls <entidade " Melisandre"> Melisandre</entidade> his enemy,condemns her for conducting human sacrifices,and says she is leading <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade> astray.
She counters that it was <entidade " Davos Seaworth"> Davos</entidade> who urged <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade> not to bring her to the battle,and implies that it was actually <entidade " Davos Seaworth"> Davos</entidade>' fault that thousands of their men burned to death,including his own son.
At the mention of his son <entidade " Davos Seaworth"> Davos</entidade> draws a knife on her in a fit of anger,but he is restrained by the guards,and <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade> orders him put in the dungeon.

<entidade " Davos Seaworth"> Davos</entidade> tries to kill <entidade " Melisandre"> Melisandre</entidade> 
In the <entidade " Riverlands"> Riverlands</entidade>,the morale of <entidade " King Robb Stark"> King Robb Stark</entidade>'s army is starting to wane.
They have not had a significant victory since the <entidade " Battle of Oxcross"> Battle of Oxcross</entidade> months ago,and the news of the <entidade " Lannisters"> Lannisters</entidade>' victory over <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade> and new alliance with the <entidade " Tyrells"> Tyrells</entidade> piles bad news upon bad news.
<entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade> has won every battle he has ever fought,but the <entidade " Lannisters"> Lannisters</entidade> finally realized it was too difficult to try to attack him head-on,so they have shifted to the new strategy of simply fleeing ahead of <entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade>'s army.
<entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade>'s forces have won many small but also insignificant minor victories,as the Lannisters are now determined to simply wait <entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade> out and exhaust his army far from home while they slowly rebuild their own numbers and gain new allies.
In frustration,<entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade> launches a new offensive to the east which takes the great castle of <entidade " Harrenhal"> Harrenhal</entidade>,which <entidade " Tywin"> Tywin</entidade> had been using it as the main <entidade " Lannisters"> Lannister</entidade> forward base in the <entidade " Riverlands"> Riverlands</entidade> during the first year of the war.
However,<entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade> does not find the decisive victory he was hoping for : <entidade " Tywin"> Tywin</entidade> withdrew his garrison to <entidade " King Stannis Baratheon"> King</entidade>'s Landing to counter the attack by <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade>,and didn't even bother wasting any men on a token defense of the castle.
<entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade> and his forces are further demoralized to find that the <entidade " Lannisters"> Lannisters</entidade> massacred two hundred <entidade " Northern"> Northern</entidade> and <entidade " Riverlands"> Riverlands</entidade> prisoners of war before they left,and the courtyards are choked with piles of bodies.
They do find one survivor,a maester named <entidade " Qyburn"> Qyburn</entidade>.

Across the <entidade " Narrow Sea"> Narrow Sea</entidade> 
<entidade " Drogon"> Drogon</entidade> roasts a fish 
<entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys Targaryen</entidade>'s ship arrives at the city of  Astapor in Slaver's <entidade " Bay"> Bay</entidade> after leaving <entidade " Qarth"> Qarth</entidade>.
<entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade>' dragons are continuing to grow,and are now about the size of small dogs.
They fly about their ship as it approaches the city,plucking fish from the sea and roasting them in mid-air with their fire-breath.She notes that they are still not big enough to use as weapons of war to invade <entidade " Westeros"> Westeros</entidade> with,and that she needs an army.
<entidade " Ser Jorah Mormont"> Ser Jorah Mormont</entidade> notes that the elite warrior-eunuchs produced in <entidade " Astapor"> Astapor</entidade>,known as the <entidade " Unsullied"> Unsullied</entidade>,are said to be among the finest soldiers in the world.
Daenerys stresses that they are slave-soldiers,a distinction which may make some look on her negatively in <entidade " Westeros"> Westeros</entidade> where slavery is illegal,but <entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> says they have no better ideas for how to acquire an army.
Daenerys expresses interest in expanding her tiny <entidade " Dothraki"> Dothraki</entidade> khalasar ( most of them are seasick because the <entidade " Dothraki"> Dothraki</entidade> have never traveled on ships before ),but <entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> says that other <entidade " Dothraki"> Dothraki</entidade> will only join her if they think she is strong,and for that she needs an army.
Upon arriving at <entidade " Astapor"> Astapor</entidade>,<entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> is given a tour of the <entidade " Unsullied"> Unsullied</entidade> barracks by the <entidade " Unsullied"> Unsullied</entidade>'s owner,<entidade " Kraznys mo Nakloz"> Kraznys mo Nakloz</entidade>,with his slave girl <entidade " Missandei"> Missandei</entidade> translating his Low  Valyrian into the Common Tongue of  Westeros for Daenerys.
They explain that the <entidade " Unsullied"> Unsullied</entidade> are trained for battle from the age of five,and that only one in four recruits survives the training.
<entidade " Kraznys mo Nakloz"> Kraznys</entidade> also demonstrates that the <entidade " Unsullied"> Unsullied</entidade> do not fear pain or death by slicing off the nipple of one soldier ( much to <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade>'s disgust ),who not only shows no sign of pain,but thanks the slavemaster for the opportunity to serve him.
<entidade " Kraznys mo Nakloz"> Kraznys</entidade> goes on to explain that the <entidade " Unsullied"> Unsullied</entidade> are trained to show no mercy or weakness by killing a newborn slave child in front of its mother at the end of their training.
<entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> is outraged by this,but still asks how many <entidade " Unsullied"> Unsullied</entidade> are available.
She is told there are eight thousand soldiers for sale and that she has until the next day to make a decision.
<entidade " En"> En</entidade> route back to their ship,<entidade " Ser Jorah Mormont"> Ser Jorah</entidade> urges that <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> should purchase the <entidade " Unsullied"> Unsullied</entidade>,arguing that under her command,these slave soldiers will have a far better quality of life serving her than they would under <entidade " Kraznys mo Nakloz"> Kraznys</entidade> and his ilk.
<entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> is distracted by a playing child following her and <entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade>,and neither notice a man in a hooded black cloak following them,armed with a dagger.

<entidade " Barristan"> Barristan</entidade> saves <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> from a deadly manticore 
The child offers a gift to <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> - a wooden ball - but as she picks it up,the hooded stranger knocks it out of her hands ; <entidade " Ser Jorah Mormont"> Ser Jorah</entidade> grabs the stranger and their struggle knocks <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> to the ground,where to her horror,the ball cracks in half and a manticore emerges to attack.
Before the creature can harm <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> with its lethal sting,the stranger impales it with his dagger and charges at the child,who hisses in a reptilian manner,baring teeth and features reminiscent of <entidade " Pyat Pree"> Pyat Pree</entidade>,and uses magic to escape.
<entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> realizes the assassin was likely an agent of the surviving <entidade " Warlocks of Qarth"> Warlocks of Qarth</entidade>.
Turning her attention to her savior,<entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> is surprised when the man addresses her as his <entidade " Queen"> Queen</entidade> and removes his hood.
She asks if <entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> knows the man.
A stunned <entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> admits he does ; the stranger before them is one of the most skilled fighters in <entidade " Westeros"> Westeros</entidade> : <entidade " Ser Barristan Selmy"> Ser Barristan Selmy</entidade>,<entidade " Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon"> Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon</entidade>'s <entidade " Kingsguard"> Kingsguard</entidade>.
Falling to his knees,<entidade " Ser Barristan Selmy"> Ser Barristan</entidade> explains that following <entidade " Robert"> Robert</entidade>'s death and his dismissal by <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade>,he has been searching for <entidade " Daenerys Stormborn"> Daenerys Stormborn</entidade>,to beg her forgiveness and offer his service,hoping to make amends for failing <entidade " House Targaryen"> House Targaryen</entidade> during and after <entidade " Robert's Rebellion"> Robert's Rebellion</entidade>,when he served in her father's <entidade " Kingsguard"> Kingsguard</entidade>.
<entidade " Barristan"> Barristan</entidade> hails her as the rightful <entidade " Queen"> Queen</entidade> and asks to serve in her <entidade " Queensguard"> Queensguard</entidade>.
