The <entidade "Hound">Hound</entidade> is judged by the gods ; <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> is judged ; <entidade "Jon">Jon</entidade> proves himself ; <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> is betrayed ; <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> learns the cost of weddings.

Beyond the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> 
<entidade "Tormund">Tormund</entidade> warns <entidade "Jon">Jon</entidade>.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Snow</entidade> is with the group of twenty wildlings under the command of <entidade "Tormund">Tormund</entidade>,who were sent ahead of the main army of <entidade "King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder">King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder</entidade> to scale the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> and attack <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade> from behind.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> and <entidade "Ygritte">Ygritte</entidade> are gathering firewood,when the warg <entidade "Orell">Orell</entidade> asks him about the defenses of the <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade>.
<entidade "Orell">Orell</entidade> has seen through the eyes of his eagle that there are patrols on top of the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> and he wants to know how frequent they are.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> says they usually sent out patrols in teams of four,two builders to inspect for structural damage and two rangers to protect them,but that the frequency of their patrols often changes.
<entidade "Orell">Orell</entidade> says the wildlings know there are nineteen castles along the south side of the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade>,but he wants to know how many are currently manned.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> finds this very unpleasant,but reluctantly says that only three are currently manned.
Apart from <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade> ( which even the wildlings know is manned ),there is also <entidade "Eastwatch-by-the-Sea">Eastwatch-by-the-Sea</entidade> at the extreme eastern end,and The <entidade "Shadow Tower">Shadow Tower</entidade> at the western end.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> is then asked how many men currently garrison <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade>.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> is very reluctant to answer,but after being threatened by <entidade "Orell">Orell</entidade>,he gives an exaggerated number,saying there are one thousand men ( this is a lie,as <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade> only had six hundred men before the <entidade "Great Ranging">Great Ranging</entidade>,and the garrison now is closer to three hundred ).
<entidade "Tormund">Tormund</entidade> tells <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> that he likes him,but if he's lying to them,he'll rip his guts out through his throat.
Ygritte is caught off-guard when <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> begins performing oral sex on her.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> and <entidade "Ygritte">Ygritte</entidade> then walk away,but she steals his sword <entidade "Longclaw">Longclaw</entidade>,making him chase her to get it back.
She leads him into a nearby cave,which is heated by natural hotsprings,which form a waterfall and a pool.
Ygritte starts disrobing,and says that she wants to make sure <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Snow</entidade> has truly come over to the wildlings' side and broken his <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade> vows - by making him break his oath of celibacy with her.
She quickly shucks off all of her clothes and walks up to him naked.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> is very hesitant to break his vows,and very shy because he's never had sex before.
<entidade "Ygritte">Ygritte</entidade> questions why he's still dressed,and they start kissing.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> continues to kiss down her body as she insists that he has no experience and therefore You know nothing,<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Sn</entidade> -- but stops mid-word as <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> starts performing oral sex on her.

<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> and <entidade "Ygritte">Ygritte</entidade> taking a bath after sex.
Some time after they finish having sex,they lie together in a naked embrace.
<entidade "Ygritte">Ygritte</entidade> asks if that thing you did with your mouth is what <entidade "Lords">Lords</entidade> do to their Ladies in the south,but <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> says she just seemed to like it when he kissed her there.
He admits he's never had sex with anyone before and is a maid,though <entidade "Ygritte">Ygritte</entidade> starts listing off some wildling boys she's had sex with before.
The first was a boy who also had red hair like her,which is rare among the wildlings and considered very lucky : they call having red hair being kissed by fire,and another was a <entidade "Thenn">Thenn</entidade> that was built like an ox,but he could not speak the <entidade "Common Tongue">Common Tongue</entidade>.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> and <entidade "Ygritte">Ygritte</entidade> then slide into the hot springs pool to take a bath together and romantically cuddle more.
<entidade "Ygritte">Ygritte</entidade> tells <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> she wishes they could stay in this cave forever ( instead of having to leave and face the winter,wars,and monsters outside ).
Across the <entidade "Narrow Sea">Narrow Sea</entidade> 
In <entidade "Slaver's Bay">Slaver's Bay</entidade>,<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</entidade>'s new army of freed <entidade "Unsullied">Unsullied</entidade>,having just sacked <entidade "Astapor">Astapor</entidade>,head north to the next of the three great slaver-cities,<entidade "Yunkai">Yunkai</entidade>.
<entidade "Jorah Mormont">Ser Jorah Mormont</entidade> tells <entidade "Barristan Selmy">Ser Barristan Selmy</entidade> how he was knighted at the end of the <entidade "Greyjoy Rebellion">Greyjoy Rebellion</entidade>,in which they both fought.
<entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> explains that he was the second man through the breach during the <entidade "Siege of Pyke">Siege of Pyke</entidade>,right behind <entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros of Myr</entidade>,who charged in headlong waving about his flaming sword.
<entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> thinks this is amusing as he wasn't there ( he was commanding the <entidade "Siege of Old Wyk">Siege of Old Wyk</entidade> at the time ).
King <entidade "Robert Baratheon">Robert Baratheon</entidade> himself knighted <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> for his bravery that day,the proudest of <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade>'s life,though he says what he was most thinking about was that he really needed to piss because he'd been sealed in metal plate armor for sixteen hours straight.
<entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> admits that <entidade "Robert Baratheon">Robert</entidade> was a good man and a good warrior,but laments that he turned out to be a terrible king.
<entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> laments that he wasted so much of his life defending kings who didn't deserve it ; seventeen years defending <entidade "Robert Baratheon">Robert</entidade>,and the <entidade "Mad King Aerys Targaryen">Mad King Aerys Targaryen</entidade> before that.
<entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> explains that a man of honor must keep his vows no matter what,whether he's serving a drunk or a lunatic ( the reason why he never turned on <entidade "King Aerys">King Aerys</entidade> the way <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</entidade> ultimately did ).
<entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> says that just once before he dies,he wants to know what it's like to serve with pride,fighting for someone he believes in.
Their talk turns to <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade>,and <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> says that <entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> can believe in her.
<entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> says she'll have good men to advise her,though he respectfully warns that it might not be well for her to be seen with <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> at her side when they return to <entidade "Westeros">Westeros</entidade> ; <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> admits that he may never be rid of the moral taint of selling slaves,which is abhorred in <entidade "Westeros">Westeros</entidade>.
<entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> then begins to subtly ask about the advisors on the <entidade "Small Council">Small Council</entidade>,if any of them spoke against <entidade "Robert Baratheon">Robert</entidade> when he wanted <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade>,the last <entidade "Targaryen">Targaryen</entidade>,assassinated.
It becomes apparent that <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> is trying to figure out if <entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> knew that <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> was initially a spy for <entidade "King Robert">King Robert</entidade>,reporting back to <entidade "Varys">Varys</entidade>.
<entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade>'s report that <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> was pregnant is what made <entidade "Robert Baratheon">Robert</entidade> demand that <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> be assassinated at a <entidade "Small Council">Small Council</entidade> meeting with <entidade "Ned Stark">Ned Stark</entidade>.
<entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> points out that the <entidade "Lord Commander of the Kingsguard">Lord Commander of the Kingsguard</entidade> traditionally holds a seat on the <entidade "Small Council">Small Council</entidade>.
However,<entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> explains that as a former <entidade "Kingsguard">Kingsguard</entidade> member under <entidade "Aerys Targaryen">Aerys Targaryen</entidade>,and one who'd killed several of <entidade "Robert Baratheon">Robert</entidade>'s friends,while <entidade "Robert Baratheon">Robert</entidade> didn't mind keeping him in his position as a guard,he never really trusted his advice,so he left him out of <entidade "Small Council">Small Council</entidade> meetings.
<entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> is relieved that <entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> was therefore not present at any council meeting so he couldn't have learned that <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> was sending it reports on <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade>.
<entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> and <entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> briefly bicker about the fact that <entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> only just came to them,while <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> was defending Daenerys from Robert Baratheon's assassins for months,and <entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> isn't <entidade "Commander">Lord Commander</entidade> here ; <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> takes his orders from <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade>.
Meanwhile,<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> and her translator aide-de-camp <entidade "Missandei">Missandei</entidade> meet with the assembled officers of the <entidade "Unsullied">Unsullied</entidade>.
She addresses them in <entidade "Low Valyrian">Low Valyrian</entidade>,and says that now that they are no longer slaves but free men and they can make their own choices,and she asked them to choose one among them to be leader of all the <entidade "Unsullied">Unsullied</entidade>.
They part ranks and one of the eunuchs steps forward.
She asks him to remove his helmet and tell her his name,and he introduces himself as <entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade>.
<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> is confused,and <entidade "Missandei">Missandei</entidade> explains that when the slavemasters of <entidade "Astapor">Astapor</entidade> castrate slave-boys to train them as Unsullied,they force new slave-names onto them which are intentionally demeaning,usually a combination of a color and a kind of vermin,i.e.
<entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade>,<entidade "Red Flea">Red Flea</entidade>,<entidade "Black Rat">Black Rat</entidade>,etc.
This is to enforce the mentality in the <entidade "Unsullied">Unsullied</entidade> that this is just what they are : worthless,expendable vermin.
Disgusted,<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> issues the command that all <entidade "Unsullied">Unsullied</entidade> must choose their own new names as free men,or reclaim the names their parents gave them.
The <entidade "Unsullied">Unsullied</entidade> commander says that he will continue to be known as <entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade> : his original name is accursed,because it was the name he had when he was taken as a slave,but <entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade> is a lucky name he will bear with pride,because it is the name he had when he was set free by <entidade "Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen">Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen</entidade>.
<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> is deeply touched by his loyalty.

In the <entidade "Seven Kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</entidade> 
At <entidade "Riverrun">Riverrun</entidade>,the prisoners <entidade "Martyn">Martyn</entidade> and <entidade "Willem Lannister">Willem Lannister</entidade> ( squires fifteen and fourteen years old,respectively ) awake to hear shouting and fighting outside the door to their cell.
<entidade "Rickard Karstark">Lord Rickard Karstark</entidade> fights his way into the room with some of his own men.
Confused,<entidade "Willem Lannister">Willem</entidade> asks if this is a rescue,and is promptly killed by the <entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade> men.
<entidade "Martyn">Martyn</entidade> begs that he is just a squire and didn't do anything,but <entidade "Rickard Karstark">Lord Rickard</entidade> ignores his pleas and stabs him in the belly with a dagger,killing him.

<entidade "Martyn">Martyn</entidade> and <entidade "Willem Lannister">Willem</entidade> lie dead before <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>.
The bloody corpses of the two <entidade "Lannister">Lannister</entidade> prisoners are laid out on the floor in front of King in the North Robb Stark in <entidade "Riverrun">Riverrun</entidade>'s main meeting room.
<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> is disgusted,remarking that <entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade> needed five men to brutally murder two unarmed squires in their own prison cell.
<entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade> insists that it was a father's vengeance.
<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> points out that these boys had nothing to do with the death of <entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade>'s sons,who were both killed by <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</entidade>.
<entidade "Rickard Karstark">Rickard</entidade> explains that he was denied his vengeance when <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>'s mother <entidade "Catelyn">Catelyn</entidade> set <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> free in hopes of a prisoner exchange for her daughters in <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade>.
Finally having enough,<entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade> did the next best thing,and killed <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>'s kin who they held prisoner.
<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> angrily shouts that they were only little boys,and <entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade> can't blame <entidade "Catelyn">Catelyn</entidade> for his treasonous killing of prisoners of war.
<entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade> stands firm,and says the only treason is in letting their enemies go,when in war they should be killing them - if <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>'s father ever taught him that.
<entidade "Brynden Tully">Brynden Tully</entidade> punches <entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade> over this remark,but <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> tells him to leave <entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade> alone.
<entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade> has utterly lost faith in <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>,and says that the King in the North will just give him a scolding,though he should probably call him the <entidade "Kingsguard">King</entidade> Who Lost the North after he allowed <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade> to fall.
Robb orders all of <entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade>'s men hanged,and to hang the lookout last so he can watch the others die.
<entidade "Rickard Karstark">Rickard Karstark</entidade> himself is sent to the dungeons.
<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>'s uncle <entidade "Edmure Tully">Edmure Tully</entidade> insists that if word of this leaves <entidade "Riverrun">Riverrun</entidade>,<entidade "Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</entidade> will exact heavy reprisals for the deaths of his young nephews.
Therefore,he suggests that they just quietly bury the boys,and simply keep silent about their deaths until the war is over.
<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>,however,refuses to be a liar : he says he can not fight a war in the name of justice if he will not serve justice to murderers within his own ranks.
All of <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>'s advisors tell him this is a bad idea.
<entidade "Catelyn">Catelyn</entidade> and his wife <entidade "Talisa">Talisa</entidade> warn him that the <entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade> soldiers will abandon his cause and return home if he executes their lord,and they are already badly outnumbered.
<entidade "Catelyn">Catelyn</entidade> says they should keep <entidade "Rickard Karstark">Lord Rickard</entidade> hostage,and <entidade "Edmure Tully">Edmure</entidade> agrees,saying that they can just keep him hostage and tell the other <entidade "Karstarks">Karstarks</entidade> that no harm will come to him so long as they remain loyal.

<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> executes <entidade "Rickard Karstark">Rickard</entidade>.
<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> ignores their pleas,and he has <entidade "Karstarks">Lord Karstark</entidade> brought out to the courtyard of <entidade "Riverrun">Riverrun</entidade> to be executed during a driving rainstorm.
<entidade "Karstarks">Karstark</entidade> points out that not only are both of their Houses descended from the <entidade "First Men">First Men</entidade>,but the <entidade "Starks">Starks</entidade> and <entidade "Karstarks">Karstarks</entidade> are <entidade "kin">kin</entidade> ( as <entidade "House Karstark">House Karstark</entidade> is a cadet branch of <entidade "House Stark">House Stark</entidade>,founded centuries ago by younger son <entidade "Karlon Stark">Karlon Stark</entidade> ).
<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> says that their blood relationship did not stop <entidade "Rickard Karstark">Rickard</entidade> from betraying him and won't stop <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> from executing him now,but <entidade "Rickard Karstark">Rickard</entidade> says it isn't meant to : he wants it to haunt <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> until the day he dies.
With his last words,<entidade "Rickard Karstark">Lord Rickard</entidade> says that <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> will be cursed ( as a kinslayer ) and that <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> is no king of his.
Obedient to the laws of his father <entidade "Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</entidade> - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> pronounces the sentence of death and personally beheads <entidade "Rickard Karstark">Lord Rickard</entidade>.
<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>'s strict adherence to justice makes things turn out just as badly as his advisors said they would : the <entidade "Karstarks">Karstarks</entidade> withdraw their soldiers from his army and march for home,resulting in <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> losing almost half of his forces which were stationed at <entidade "Riverrun">Riverrun</entidade>.
<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> openly admits to Talisa that she was right,and he made a mistake.
<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> says <entidade "Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</entidade> realizes that he's in such a strong position he doesn't even need to attack the <entidade "Northerners">Northerners</entidade> anymore,he just needs to wait,and let their demoralized forces unravel.
When the war began <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>'s army was unified around a central purpose,but now they have lost momentum,and his generals are acting like bickering children.
Robb shows <entidade "Talisa">Talisa</entidade> a war map of the <entidade "Seven Kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</entidade> - depicting <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>'s armies concentrated around <entidade "Riverrun">Riverrun</entidade> and <entidade "Harrenhal">Harrenhal</entidade>,<entidade "Lannister">Lannister</entidade> and <entidade "Tyrell">Tyrell</entidade> armies overrunning the <entidade "Stormlands">Stormlands</entidade>,<entidade "Lannister Tyrell">Lannister Tyrell</entidade> armies concentrated in <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade>,and <entidade "Greyjoy">Greyjoy</entidade> forces occupying the western coasts of the <entidade "Northerners">North</entidade>.
<entidade "Talisa">Talisa</entidade> suggests that he try to take the fight to the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade> if they won't come to him,but he explains that this is hopeless.
Taking <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade> would have been difficult to begin with,but now <entidade "Tywin Lannister">Tywin</entidade> and the bulk of the main <entidade "Lannister Tyrell">Lannister</entidade> army,as well as a large <entidade "Tyrell">Tyrell</entidade> army,are defending the city.
Attacking the capital head-on would be suicide,and <entidade "Tywin Lannister">Tywin</entidade> would crush them within a day.
<entidade "Talisa">Talisa</entidade> suggests that he lead his army back to the <entidade "Northerners">North</entidade> to repulse the <entidade "Greyjoys">Greyjoys</entidade> from his homeland and rebuild his powerbase.
<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> points out that as soon as all of his tired soldiers are back home,they won't want to leave again - particularly because winter is coming,and the coming one is expected to be very long,five years or more.
The Northerners have been away from their farms fighting in the war,however,so they haven't even begun to collect harvests to set aside as winter stockpiles.
Thus if <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> returns to the <entidade "Northerners">North</entidade>,it will be difficult to rally his men to return south to defend the <entidade "Riverlords">Riverlords</entidade> who declared for him.
Eyeing the map with <entidade "Talisa">Talisa</entidade>,<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> decides that if <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade> is too strong to attack and he can't return home,his only remaining option is to strike where his enemy is weakest.
<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> decides that with the main <entidade "Lannisters">Lannister</entidade> army-group under <entidade "Tywin Lannister">Tywin</entidade> now positioned all the way to the east in <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade>,he needs to return to the <entidade "Westerlands">Westerlands</entidade> and make an all-or-nothing assault against <entidade "Casterly Rock">Casterly Rock</entidade>.
This will make the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade> lose face,just as <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> did when he lost his home castle of <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade>,and bring momentum back to his army.
However,with the loss of the <entidade "Karstarks">Karstark</entidade> forces,they don't currently have enough men to consider attacking <entidade "Casterly Rock">Casterly Rock</entidade>.
The only way they can gain enough soldiers to even attempt such an assault is if <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> can win back the allegiance of <entidade "House Frey">House Frey</entidade>,whose thousands of soldiers withdrew from <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>'s army when he broke his promise to make a marriage-alliance with them by marrying <entidade "Talisa">Talisa</entidade>,a political nobody,instead of one of the <entidade "Walder Frey">Lord Walder Frey</entidade>'s daughters.
Thus,<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> must try to repair his alliance with <entidade "House Frey">House Frey</entidade>.

<entidade "Locke">Locke</entidade> taunting <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> about his hand.
At <entidade "Harrenhal">Harrenhal</entidade>,<entidade "Locke">Locke</entidade> presents the captive <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</entidade> and <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne of Tarth</entidade> to the <entidade "Northerners">Northern</entidade> castellan,<entidade "Roose Bolton">Lord Roose Bolton</entidade>.
<entidade "Locke">Locke</entidade> is quite proud of himself for his torture of <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>,but <entidade "Roose Bolton">Roose</entidade> is surprised that <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> has lost his hand.
Oblivious,<entidade "Locke">Locke</entidade> boasts that <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> hasn't lost the hand,and points out that he cut it off and hung <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>'s own hand around his neck.
Angered that Locke maimed such a valuable hostage,<entidade "Bolton">Bolton</entidade> demands that he dispose of <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>'s rotting hand,and orders that accommodations be provided for the pair of prisoners.
When <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> asks if there is news from the capital,<entidade "Bolton">Bolton</entidade> informs him that <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</entidade> laid siege to the city in the <entidade "Battle of the Blackwater">Battle of the Blackwater</entidade> ... then needlessly drags out revealing the result.
<entidade "Bolton">Bolton</entidade> toys with <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> but remains completely calm,never even grinning,before finally revealing that his sister <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> is alive and well,and his father's forces successfully repulsed <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade>'s assault.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> is so overcome by delirium and relief that his family is safe that he collapses.
<entidade "Bolton">Bolton</entidade> calls for <entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> to attend to <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>'s injuries.
Later,<entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> peels away the crude tourniquet that <entidade "Locke">Locke</entidade>'s men applied to <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>,and finds that the stump of his right arm has become badly infected.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> asks if he will die,and <entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> says he won't,but the corruption has spread to the point that it would be safest just to amputate the rest of his right arm at the shoulder.
Half-delirious from the infection,<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> refuses,and says he'll kill <entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> if he tries.
Jaime then notices that <entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> is not a Maester,because he isn't wearing a maester's chain of office.
Qyburn acknowledges this,explaining that he was stripped of his chain by the <entidade "Citadel">Citadel</entidade> and thrown out of the <entidade "Order of Maesters">Order of Maesters</entidade>,because as he says,he was conducting experiments which they felt were too bold.
<entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> gets ready to cut <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>,and says he'll at least try to save his elbow,but with a sudden burst of effort <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> grabs him around the throat with his left hand,and says he doesn't need his right hand to kill him.
Qyburn relents,and says he could try cutting out the chunks of flesh which are outright rotten,then burning out the wounds with boiling wine,and with luck this might be able to stop the infection without having to amputate more of <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>'s arm above the wrist.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> says he's willing to try this,but <entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> cautions that it will cause a great amount of pain so he needs to give him <entidade "Milk of the Poppy">Milk of the Poppy</entidade>,but <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> refuses to take it,and says he'll just scream.
<entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> cautions him that it will cause a massive amount of pain,but <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> says that he will just scream loudly.
Qyburn begins to dig into the stump of <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>'s arm to cut out the gangrenous tissue,and <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> howls in agony.
Some time later,<entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> is in <entidade "Harrenhal">Harrenhal</entidade>'s bathhouse,scrubbing off weeks' worth of caked on grime and filth from the trek through the <entidade "Riverlands">Riverlands</entidade>.
Jaime then appears in the doorway assisted by a servant,barely able to stand due to the pain he is in.
He asks the servant to help him take off his muddy rags and leave.
Jaime then walks naked into the same communal bath that <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> is in,on the far side.
She is also naked and angrily points out that there are other baths,but he says he wants this one ; he's afraid he's going to pass out at any moment,and wants her to save him from drowning if he does,because he doesn't want to be the first <entidade "Lannister Tyrell">Lannister</entidade> to die in a bathtub.
<entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> asks why she should care how he dies,but he points out that she swore a solemn vow to get him to <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade> in one piece - which ( indicating the stump of his hand ) has not been going so well.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> quips that it's no wonder Renly died with <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> guarding him,at which she defiantly stands up out of the bath,facing him fully nude,to show him she isn't afraid of him.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> gravely says that was unworthy and asks for forgiveness,<entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> angrily orders him not to mock her,but he insists he's seriously apologizing.
Exhausted,<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> says he's tired of fighting and just wants to have a truce ; <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> says you need trust to have a truce,but he says he trusts her,so she sits back down.

Jaime recounts Aerys's madness.
Jaime then notes that <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> has the same look on her face that he's seen on countless faces in the past seventeen years : people that despise him,call him kingslayer more than his own name,or oathbreaker and a man without honor.
Jaime then goes on to recall the <entidade "Mad King's">Mad King's</entidade> obsession with wildfire,how <entidade "Aerys">Aerys</entidade> enjoyed watching people being burned alive.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> recalls <entidade "Aerys">Aerys</entidade> burned lords he didn't like,<entidade "Hands">Hands</entidade> who failed him,and anyone he thought was against him.
Ultimately,half of <entidade "Westeros">Westeros</entidade> rebelled against him,so <entidade "Aerys">Aerys</entidade> had his pyromancers place caches of wildfire all over <entidade "King's Landing">King</entidade>'s Landing : under the <entidade "Great Sept of Baelor">Great Sept of Baelor</entidade>,under the slums of <entidade "Flea Bottom">Flea Bottom</entidade>,under houses,stables,taverns,and even under the <entidade "Red Keep">Red Keep</entidade> itself.
After <entidade "Robert's">Robert's</entidade> victory at the <entidade "Trident">Trident</entidade> he marched on the capital city,but <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>'s father <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> arrived there first,leading the entire <entidade "Lannister Tyrell">Lannister</entidade> army,and promising to defend the city.
Jaime warned Aerys that his father was never a man to choose the losing side,that this must be a trick and he should surrender the city while he still could,but the <entidade "Mad King's">Mad King</entidade> refused to listen.
Nor did <entidade "Aerys">Aerys</entidade> listen to Varys when he gave the same warning that <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> couldn't be trusted - but he did listen to <entidade "Pycelle">Grand Maester Pycelle</entidade>,who convinced <entidade "Aerys">Aerys</entidade> the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade> were there to help.
Aerys opened the city gates,and the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade> proceeded to sack the city.
Jaime again begged <entidade "Aerys">Aerys</entidade> to surrender,but the <entidade "Mad King's">Mad King</entidade> ordered <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> to bring him <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade>'s head,and his pyromancer to set the city ablaze,burning its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants with wildfire.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> makes it plain to <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> that was his breaking point and asks her what she would do if her precious Renly commanded her to kill her own father and then stand by and do nothing as he murdered thousands of innocent people ; she can only sit in shocked silence.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> goes on to say that he killed the pyromancer first,then drove his sword into <entidade "Aerys">Aerys</entidade>'s back as the <entidade "Mad King's">Mad King</entidade> tried to run for his life.
Shaken at the memory,<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> speculates that King <entidade "Aerys">Aerys</entidade> didn't believe he would die in the blaze ; in his lunacy,the <entidade "Mad King's">Mad King</entidade> believed he would be reborn as a dragon in the fire,granting him the power to burn his enemies to ashes ... so <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> finished <entidade "Aerys">Aerys</entidade> off by slitting his throat in order to make sure he died,concluding that <entidade "Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</entidade> found him at that point.
Stunned,<entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> asks why <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> didn't defend himself with this account before.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> angrily rants that the honorable <entidade "Stark">Lord Stark</entidade> would never have believed a word he said : <entidade "Stark">Stark</entidade> didn't want to hear <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>'s side of the story when he'd already judged him guilty.
Jaime faints.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> goes on to rage,yelling what right <entidade "Stark">Stark</entidade> had to judge him,by what right the wolf dares to judge the lion.
The strain of recounting his harrowing tale overcomes <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>,however,and he begins to faint,nearly falling face-first into the water.
<entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> catches him and calls for help for the <entidade "Kingslayer">Kingslayer</entidade>,at which ( as he slips out of consciousness ) he whimpers to himself <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>.
My name is <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> ... 
The <entidade "Hound">Hound</entidade> vs <entidade "Beric">Beric</entidade>.
Elsewhere in the <entidade "Riverlands">Riverlands</entidade>,at the hideout of the Brotherhood Without Banners in Hollow Hill,<entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor Clegane</entidade> prepares to fight <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric Dondarrion</entidade> in a trial by combat.
As both men prepare,<entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros of Myr</entidade> prays to the <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade> to judge <entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor</entidade> for his crimes if he is guilty or give strength to his sword if he is innocent.
Before the fight begins,<entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> calls upon the <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade> to ignite his sword with flame,using only his blood.
Due to the <entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor</entidade>'s fear of fire,<entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> initially has an advantage against the <entidade "Hound">Hound</entidade>.
<entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> even manages to set <entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor</entidade>'s wooden shield on fire,which is strapped so tightly to <entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor</entidade>'s arm that he can not remove it and is nearly burned himself.
Eventually,however,<entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor</entidade>'s raw physical strength and anger ( born of terror ) overpowers <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade>,and with a single downward swipe,cuts right through his flaming sword,his armor,and deep into his shoulder,killing him.

<entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros</entidade> reviving <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade>.
As <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> falls to the ground,<entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros</entidade> quickly rushes to his side,and begins praying to the <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade> to revive him.
<entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor</entidade> falls to the ground to desperately try and extinguish his flaming shield.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya Stark</entidade> grabs a dagger and attempts to kill the <entidade "Hound">Hound</entidade> while he is down,but she is stopped by <entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade>.
As she curses him,<entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor</entidade> taunts <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> over how the god prefers him over her dead friend,however they are both interrupted by <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade>,who has been revived by the <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade>'s power.
Having won the trial,and proven his innocence in the eyes of god,<entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor</entidade> is allowed to leave.
The <entidade "Brotherhood">Brotherhood</entidade> had taken all of the gold <entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor</entidade> had on him ( to fund their cause ),and in lieu of returning it,<entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> gives him a promissory note which will grant payment at the end of the war.
<entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor</entidade> scoffs at this and throws it to the ground,but <entidade "Anguy">Anguy</entidade> says he should be thankful they're letting him leave with his life.
<entidade "Clegane">Clegane</entidade> is hooded so he won't know the way back to their hideout,then led away to be released some distance away.
After the fight,<entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade> works on repairing <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade>'s armor,and <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> questions why,because they will be leaving soon.
<entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade> says that he has decided to stay and work as a smith for the <entidade "Brotherhood Without Banners">Brotherhood Without Banners</entidade>,to aid them in their cause to protect the smallfolk during the war.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> says that their plan was to find her brother <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>,and <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> needs soldiers too,but <entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade> points out that he has no attachments to <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb Stark</entidade> : <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> would be going to her noble-born family,and he'd just be serving another lord.
<entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade> says he's been serving other men his whole life and he has nothing to show for it : he worked most of his life for <entidade "Tobho Mott">Tobho Mott</entidade> and he repaid <entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade> by selling him to the <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade> ( as soon as the secret payments from <entidade "Varys">Varys</entidade> ended ),and he served <entidade "Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</entidade> as a prisoner at <entidade "Harrenhal">Harrenhal</entidade>,every day afraid he'd be killed or tortured.
He'd be serving in the <entidade "Brotherhood Without Banners">Brotherhood</entidade> too,but they chose <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> as their leader,and they're more like a family - and as a common-born tavern maiden's son who was orphaned at a young age,<entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade> has never had a family.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> sadly chokes out that she could be his family.
In response,<entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade> politely but firmly points out that the class differences between them mean that if he goes back with her,they'd never be family : he'd still be a commoner,and she'd bem'lady.
Later that night,<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> looks into the campfire and recites her nightly prayer-list for the death of her enemies.
<entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros</entidade> says that they plan to bring her to Riverrun to reunite her with her family,and in exchange for a reward from <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade> to fund their cause.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> points out that they are ransoming her,and <entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros</entidade> admits they technically are,but this is different.
They do intend to escort her safely through the war-ravaged countryside to her family,and <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> would like to return her for free out of memory of her father,but they really need the gold to support themselves.
<entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> says he knows she must be angry with him,but releasing <entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor</entidade> was the right thing to do,as they'd promised to let him go free if he won the trial by combat.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> is still quietly upset,as she's now seen many honorable men keep their promises and behave lawfully only to be killed for it ( such as <entidade "Yoren">Yoren</entidade> and her own father ).
She wonders why <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> would want to let <entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor</entidade> go when he nearly killed him,but <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> insists that he did actually kill him.
When <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> asks how,<entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> points her to Thoros to explain,but he says that he isn't the one who brings <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> back to life,it's the <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade>,and <entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros</entidade> is just the lucky drunk who recites the prayers.
<entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> opens his shirt to reveal several grievous scars on his torso : they explain that <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> has actually died and then been brought back to life six times now,counting his recent death in the trial by combat.
He has been impaled on a lance,shot with an arrow,and at his fifth death the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade> hanged him for treason and stuck a dagger in his eye ( which didn't heal when <entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros</entidade> brought him back ).
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> earnestly asks <entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros</entidade> if he could bring back to life a man without a head.
Thoros and <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> both understand that she is asking about bringing back her father,but <entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros</entidade> says he doesn't think it works that way ( both because he was decapitated,and because he's been dead for far too long by now ).
Beric consoles her that her father was a good man,but he wouldn't wish his resurrected life on him.
<entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> explains that being brought back from the dead carries a heavy toll,as pieces of his memory and who he was before chip away each time.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> still says she would wish <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade>'s life on her father,because at least <entidade "Beric Dondarrion">Beric</entidade> is still alive.

At <entidade "Dragonstone">Dragonstone</entidade>,<entidade "King Stannis Baratheon">King Stannis Baratheon</entidade> is still deeply depressed after his defeat at the <entidade "Battle of the Blackwater">Battle of the Blackwater</entidade>,and doesn't have the daily support of the <entidade "Red Priestess Melisandre">Red Priestess Melisandre</entidade> since she left on what she claimed was an important mission.
Most of <entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade>' army has been destroyed,and the only reason the Lannisters haven't attacked <entidade "Dragonstone">Dragonstone</entidade> yet is because so much of their fleet was destroyed at <entidade "Blackwater">Blackwater</entidade> that they can not yet mount an amphibious assault.
With little else to do,<entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade> takes the time to visit his wife,<entidade "Selyse">Queen Selyse</entidade> ( who was born into <entidade "House Florent">House Florent</entidade> ),for the first time since returning from the battle.
He finds her in her chamber,praying over a fire to the <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade> : <entidade "Selyse">Selyse</entidade> is a fanatical believer in the <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade> religion,far more so than <entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade>,and it was indeed <entidade "Selyse">Selyse</entidade> who first invited <entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> to <entidade "Dragonstone">Dragonstone</entidade>.
<entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade> and <entidade "Selyse">Selyse</entidade> do not have a loving relationship,but she reveres and is in awe of him as her king and the <entidade "Lord's Chosen">Lord's Chosen</entidade>.
She tells him not to despair despite his defeat,and he will be victorious,but he laments that he used to believe that once.
Due to his extreme belief in duty,( unlike his hedonistic brother <entidade "Robert">Robert</entidade> ) <entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade> is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to <entidade "Selyse">Selyse</entidade>,when he had sex with <entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> to create the Shadow-assassin creature that killed Renly.
He begins to confess to Selyse that he has sinned and shamed her,but she interrupts him and says <entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> already told her everything - and that no act done in service of the <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade> can be a sin.
Indeed,she wept for joy when <entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> told her of this service she did for the <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade> with <entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade>,and because the <entidade "Red Priestess Melisandre">Red Priestess</entidade> gave him a son ( of sorts ) which she never could.
<entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade>' face is filled with a mix of shock,disgust,and relief.
<entidade "Selyse">Selyse</entidade> had three sons with <entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade> but they were all stillborn,and she walks over to a corner of her chamber where she keeps their tiny corpses preserved in glass jars.
The deaths of her sweet boys and failure to produce a male heir deeply affected <entidade "Selyse">Selyse</entidade>,and caused her to zealously embrace the foreign religion of the <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade>.
She weeps,and laments that she has given <entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade> nothing - he does not blame her,and with pity he says that's not true.
<entidade "Selyse">Selyse</entidade> understands he is referring to their daughter and only child,<entidade "Shireen Baratheon">Princess Shireen Baratheon</entidade>.
She grows annoyed when she realizes he's come to see her too,and says he shouldn't waste time on such distractions,but insists that she is his daughter,and she relents because it is not her place to question her king.
Shireen visits <entidade "Davos">Davos</entidade> while in the dungeons.
<entidade "Shireen Baratheon">Shireen</entidade> is alone in her room drawing and singing a song about life under the sea to herself,and is excited to see her father.
She is a cheerful but sickly young girl ( about the same age as <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya Stark</entidade> ),with the left side of her face badly scarred and disfigured by the dreaded <entidade "Greyscale">Greyscale</entidade> disease.
<entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade> wanted to see his daughter,but he is awkward in expressing warm emotions to her.
She says she heard he was in a battle and asks if he won,and he good-naturedly says no.
<entidade "Shireen Baratheon">Shireen</entidade> is slightly let-down,but asks if the <entidade "Onion Knight">Onion Knight</entidade> came back as well : <entidade "Davos Seaworth">Ser Davos Seaworth</entidade> has been her friend during his service to her father,and he even made her a toy ship.
Growing tense over their falling out,<entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade> briefly explains that <entidade "Davos Seaworth">Ser Davos</entidade> is a traitor and is rotting in the dungeon.
Confused,he flatly says she should best put him out of her mind.
Later that night,<entidade "Shireen Baratheon">Shireen</entidade> sneaks down to the dungeon of <entidade "Dragonstone">Dragonstone</entidade> and finds the cell of <entidade "Onion Knight">Ser Onion Knight</entidade>.
He wakes up and tells her she shouldn't be there,but she explains that the fat guard <entidade "Bert">Bert</entidade> is on duty,who usually drinks a lot of wine and sleeps through his watch.
She asks if it is true that he is a traitor,and he says that it is,as he disobeyed her father.
She says she doesn't care,he's her friend.
She was worried that he must get bored down in his cell,so she brought him a book to read,about <entidade "Aegon">Aegon</entidade> the <entidade "Conquer">Conquer</entidade> and his dragons - she excitedly points out that the <entidade "Targaryens">Targaryens</entidade> built <entidade "Dragonstone">Dragonstone</entidade>,and <entidade "Aegon">Aegon</entidade> used to live in this very castle.
<entidade "Davos Seaworth">Davos</entidade> reluctantly explains that it's wasted on him,because he doesn't know how to read.
Undaunted,<entidade "Shireen Baratheon">Shireen</entidade> offers to teach him how to read,by coming down to his cell and reading to him when <entidade "Bert">Bert</entidade> is on duty.
<entidade "Davos Seaworth">Davos</entidade> chides her that they can't,but she asks what's the worst the guards could do to them if they find out,lock them in cells ? 
They have a quiet laugh,and <entidade "Shireen Baratheon">Shireen</entidade> starts to read to Davos An History of <entidade "Aegon">Aegon</entidade> the <entidade "Conqueror">Conqueror</entidade> and His <entidade "Conquest of Westeros">Conquest of Westeros</entidade>.
In <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade>,<entidade "Regent Cersei Lannister">Queen Regent Cersei Lannister</entidade> encounters <entidade "Petyr Littlefinger Baelish">Petyr Littlefinger Baelish</entidade> in a courtyard,and tells him she fears that the <entidade "Tyrells">Tyrells</entidade> do not have the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade>' best interests at heart,but her father won't listen.
Therefore,she asks that <entidade "Littlefinger">Littlefinger</entidade> use his spies to try to find out what they're up to,because he has a good working relationship with them after brokering the <entidade "Lannister-Tyrell">Lannister-Tyrell</entidade> alliance.
He agrees,but <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> warns him that this had better produce more results than when she previously asked him to find <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya Stark</entidade>,but the girl could not be found.

In the castle gardens,<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa Stark</entidade> and <entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery Tyrell</entidade> watch her brother <entidade "Loras">Ser Loras</entidade> spar with his squire.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> confidently remarks on his fighting ability,and inquires when she and <entidade "Loras">Loras</entidade> will wed,as per the <entidade "Tyrells">Tyrell</entidade> plot to keep her out of the hands of <entidade "Baelish">Baelish</entidade> and or the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade>.
<entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade> replies that she will plant the seed of the idea after she and <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> are married.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> is skeptical <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> will let her go but <entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade> is confident he will do it to please her,once she is his wife.
After the match,<entidade "Loras">Ser Loras</entidade>' new squire <entidade "Olyvar">Olyvar</entidade> flirts with him,which leads to them having sex back in <entidade "Loras">Loras</entidade>' chambers.
As they finish,<entidade "Loras">Loras</entidade> mentions that he is engaged to be married ... a fact that <entidade "Olyvar">Olyvar</entidade> passes on to his real master,<entidade "Littlefinger">Littlefinger</entidade>,so he can pass the information on to <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade>.
Loras and <entidade "Olyvar">Olyvar</entidade> 
A short time later,<entidade "Littlefinger">Littlefinger</entidade> meets with <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade>,offering her a place on his ship that will take him from the capital to the <entidade "Vale of Arryn">Vale of Arryn</entidade>.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> practices lying for a change,and tells him that they should wait until after <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade>'s wedding,primarily because she fears for his safety if the plan fails.
A master manipulator,<entidade "Littlefinger">Littlefinger</entidade> is clearly suspicious of her motives,but doesn't press the matter for the moment.
Instead he says he is touched by her concern for his safety,and insists that she call him <entidade "Petyr Littlefinger Baelish">Petyr</entidade>.
At the same time,<entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</entidade> is engaged in a meeting with <entidade "Lady Olenna Tyrell">Lady Olenna Tyrell</entidade> ; with the upcoming royal wedding shaping up to be an extravagant and expensive affair,<entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> is concerned about the cost.
<entidade "Olenna">Olenna</entidade> points out that the <entidade "Tyrells">Tyrells</entidade> have done much to supply the city with soldiers and provisions to assist in the war effort,as well as the coming winter.
<entidade "Olenna">Olenna</entidade> is bored to discuss financial matters,but quickly lists off specific details of the soldiers and supplies the <entidade "Tyrells">Tyrells</entidade> are supplying to aid the crown,demonstrating that <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> doesn't need to lecture her about wartime expenses.
She insists that the royal wedding must go on as planned,as it will do much to improve the city's morale and keep the people happy,otherwise they will start blaming the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade> for the war again.
Tyrion can not outmaneuver <entidade "Olenna">Olenna</entidade>,but in the end she decides on her own that she won't have it said <entidade "House Tyrell">House Tyrell</entidade> isn't doing its part to help,so she agrees to pay for half the cost of the festivities,for which <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> is grateful.
Tyrion heads to the <entidade "Small Council">Small Council</entidade> chamber to report success to his father <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade>,only to find <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> present as well,much to his annoyance.
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> explains that the <entidade "Tyrells">Tyrells</entidade> are plotting to wed <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> to <entidade "Loras">Ser Loras</entidade> and states that he will not allow them to steal the key to the north out from under him.
Tyrion questions how <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> is the key to the <entidade "North">North</entidade>,given that her older brother is still alive.
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> explains that the desertion of the <entidade "Karstarks">Karstarks</entidade> have cost <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb Stark</entidade> half his army,and ( combined with already being badly outnumbered by the <entidade "Lannister-Tyrell">Lannister-Tyrell</entidade> alliance ) his days are now numbered.
<entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon Greyjoy</entidade> murdered <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade>'s younger brothers at <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade>,which makes <entidade "Sansa Robb">Sansa Robb</entidade>'s heir : if he dies,rule of <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade> and the <entidade "North">North</entidade> goes to her and any man she marries ... which <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> has no intention of letting the <entidade "Tyrells">Tyrells</entidade> get their hands on.
Tyrion questions if it is wise to offend their allies by refusing the match,but <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> points out that as a plot against them,the <entidade "Tyrells">Tyrells</entidade>' plan is,by definition,a secret,thus the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade> can't be said to be refusing them something which they aren't officially trying to do.
He also notes that the <entidade "Tyrells">Tyrells</entidade> won't go through with their plan until after <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade>'s wedding,which means they need to act first ... namely by finding <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> another husband.

After a moment,<entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> realizes from the comments of his father and sister that they are talking about him.
Tyrion tries to protest,pointing out that <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> has made <entidade "Sansa Robb">Sansa</entidade>'s life a living hell since the day he had her father executed and to force Tyrion on her after she has finally escaped <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> is cruel,even by <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade>'s standards.
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> questions if <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> plans to mistreat <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> and asserts that he is not concerned with the girl's happiness and neither should his son.
Tyrion protests that <entidade "Sansa Robb">Sansa</entidade> is a child,but <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> counters she has flowered and is a woman now who can bear children.
<entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> flatly refuses,but <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> points out that recently he was complaining that he wasn't rewarded for his actions in the <entidade "Battle of the Blackwater">Battle of the Blackwater</entidade>,and as heiress to the <entidade "North">North</entidade>,<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> is a far better reward than he could expect,and in any case,it is long past time <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> was wed. At this,<entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> snarls that he was wed,referring to his past marriage to <entidade "Tysha">Tysha</entidade>,asking if his father has forgotten that.
Returning his son's hateful glare with one of his own,<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> retorts that he remembers all too well.
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> arranges some marriages.
<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> gloats over the matter,but her smug attitude quickly evaporates when her father commands that she will wed <entidade "Loras">Ser Loras</entidade> instead.
<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> flatly refuses,but <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> is insistent : the marriages of <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> and <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> will place the <entidade "North">North</entidade> and the <entidade "Reach">Reach</entidade> firmly in the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade>' control.
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> points out that <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> is still fertile : she needs to marry and breed.
When <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> protests she is Queen <entidade "Regent Cersei Lannister">Regent</entidade> and not a brood mare,<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> angrily roars back that she is his daughter and will do as she is told : she will marry <entidade "Loras">Loras</entidade> and in so doing,put an end to what <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> calls the disgusting rumors <entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade> has been spreading about her and <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade>.
<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> switches to earnestly begging him,calling him father and pleading that he not force her into an arranged marriage a second time ( after her long and loveless marriage with <entidade "King Robert">King Robert</entidade> ).
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> refuses to listen and storms out in disgust,raging that the pair have disgraced the <entidade "Lannister-Tyrell">Lannister</entidade> name for far too long.
<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> slowly shifts her gaze toward <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> to gauge his reaction to her distress but sees he is too glum about his own predicament.
