Afterwards <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> confronts Orell about cutting his and <entidade " Ygritte's"> Ygritte's</entidade> rope loose on The <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade>,nearly killing the both of them in the process.
<entidade " Orell"> Orell</entidade> tells <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> that he doesn't see <entidade " Ygritte's"> Ygritte</entidade> complaining about what happened because she is a wildling and understood what needed to be done in a pressure situation,also telling <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> that this is the reason he will never be able to keep her.
During the journey through the woods,a clearly jealous <entidade " Orell"> Orell</entidade> confronts <entidade " Ygritte's"> Ygritte</entidade> and says that he would be a better man for her than <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon Snow</entidade>,while continuing to express his distrust in <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade>.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> also tries to persuade <entidade " Ygritte's"> Ygritte</entidade> that the wildlings' cause is doomed to failure,but she refuses to listen and points out that <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> is technically one of them ; if it fails,so does he.
She renews her passion for him and tells him bluntly that if they die,they die,but before they die they will live in each other.

Across the <entidade " Narrow Sea"> Narrow Sea</entidade> 
<entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys Targaryen</entidade>'s army marches on to the next great city of <entidade " Slaver's Bay"> Slaver's Bay</entidade>,<entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade>.
She and <entidade " Barristan Selmy"> Barristan Selmy</entidade> are confident they can take the city,given that <entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade> are famous for training bed slaves rather than soldiers.
<entidade " Ser Jorah"> Ser Jorah</entidade> notes with wisdom however that <entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade>'s defenders won't fight them in open battle,being more likely to hole up behind their walls and chip away at the <entidade " Targaryen"> Targaryen</entidade> army with guerrilla tactics.
He also advises <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> that conquering <entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade> does not help them with their main goal of pressing on to retake <entidade " Westeros"> Westeros</entidade>.
<entidade " Dany"> Dany</entidade> however is adamant on freeing the slaves of <entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade>,who number in the hundreds of thousands.
She orders <entidade " Grey Worm"> Grey Worm</entidade> to send a messenger to the city and inform <entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade>'s slaver rulers that they must either surrender or suffer the same fate as <entidade " Astapor"> Astapor</entidade>.
The Yunkish herald is carried into <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade>'s camp on a litter carried by slaves,along a road flanked by <entidade " Unsullied"> Unsullied</entidade>.
<entidade " Missandei"> Missandei</entidade> announces the newcomer as <entidade " Razdal"> Razdal</entidade> mo <entidade " Eraz"> Eraz</entidade>,one of the ruling <entidade " Wise Masters of Yunkai"> Wise Masters of Yunkai</entidade>.
<entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> meets the man in her pavilion,flanked by her dragons who vie for her attention and fight over the pieces of meat she tosses to them ; they also snarl at <entidade " Razdal"> Razdal</entidade> when he gets too close.
<entidade " Razdal"> Razdal</entidade> declares that <entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade> was an ancient civilization long before the rise of <entidade " Valyria"> Valyria</entidade> and that numerous armies throughout history have tried and failed to conquer it.
However <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> is not threatened,commenting that a hard-fought battle would give her <entidade " Unsullied"> Unsullied</entidade> much needed practice.
<entidade " Razdal"> Razdal</entidade> tries a different tact,asserting there is no need for their factions to fight,that <entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade> is willing to overlook her attack on <entidade " Astapor"> Astapor</entidade> and will even provide her with the gold and ships needed to transport her army to <entidade " Westeros"> Westeros</entidade>.
In exchange,they ask that <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> leave <entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade> in peace.
<entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> makes a counter-offer : she will spare the lives of <entidade " Razdal"> Razdal</entidade> and the slave-masters of <entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade> if every slave ( men,women and children ) in the city is set free,and given as much food,clothing and property as they can carry in payment for their services.
She warns that if her offer is rejected,<entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade> will be shown no mercy.
<entidade " Razdal"> Razdal</entidade> takes offense,promising that <entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade> will be more of a challenge for her than <entidade " Astapor"> Astapor</entidade> or <entidade " Qarth"> Qarth</entidade>,and threatens her with the retribution of <entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade>'s powerful friends who he claims will take great pleasure in destroying her army and enslaving the survivors.
At that,<entidade " Drogon"> Drogon</entidade> and his siblings roar in anger ; <entidade " Razdal"> Razdal</entidade> protests that he was promised safe conduct,to which <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> counters that her dragons made no such promise and take offense to him threatening their mother.
After the dragons prevent his slaves from reclaiming the chests of gold he brought with him,<entidade " Razdal"> Razdal</entidade> storms out of the pavilion,muttering curses.
<entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> tells <entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> to find out more about <entidade " Yunkai"> Yunkai</entidade>'s powerful friends before she commits herself to an attack on the city.

In the <entidade " Seven Kingdoms"> Seven Kingdoms</entidade> 
Traveling back from the <entidade " Riverlands"> Riverlands</entidade>,a ship carrying <entidade " Melisandre"> Melisandre</entidade> and <entidade " Gendry"> Gendry</entidade> leaves <entidade " King's Landing"> King's Landing</entidade> and passes through <entidade " Blackwater Bay"> Blackwater Bay</entidade>.
<entidade " Melisandre"> Melisandre</entidade> stares at the broken wrecks of <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade>'s fleet destroyed by the wildfire,asserting that her presence might have turned the tide of battle.
She questions <entidade " Gendry"> Gendry</entidade> and is surprised to learn he is unaware of his father's real identity.
As they pass by the <entidade " Red Keep"> Red Keep</entidade>,<entidade " Melisandre"> Melisandre</entidade> reveals to Gendry that he is King <entidade " Robert Baratheon"> Robert Baratheon</entidade>'s bastard son.
In The <entidade " North"> North</entidade>,on their way to the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade>,<entidade " Bran Stark"> Bran Stark</entidade>'s party makes camp.
<entidade " Osha"> Osha</entidade> remains distrustful of <entidade " Meera"> Meera</entidade> and <entidade " Jojen Reed"> Jojen Reed</entidade> and reacts with horror when they mention they intend to go beyond the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade>.
<entidade " Osha"> Osha</entidade> bluntly refuses to go,explaining that she lost her husband,who then rose from the dead and tried to kill her.
She rages that none of them understand what lies beyond the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> and that there is nothing left for men there.
At the camp of the <entidade " Brotherhood Without Banners"> Brotherhood Without Banners</entidade>,<entidade " Arya"> Arya</entidade>,disillusioned with the <entidade " Brotherhood Without Banners"> Brotherhood</entidade> for selling <entidade " Gendry"> Gendry</entidade>,takes an opportunity to escape and runs off into the night.
Before she gets too far,however,she is snatched up by <entidade " Sandor Clegane"> Sandor Clegane</entidade>,who was lying in wait for her.
In the <entidade " Riverlands"> Riverlands</entidade>,en route to The <entidade " Twins"> Twins</entidade>,<entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb Stark</entidade>'s army is forced to make camp,their progress delayed by heavy rain.
<entidade " Catelyn"> Catelyn</entidade> warns them that the prickly <entidade " Lord Walder Frey"> Lord Walder Frey</entidade> will take the delay as a deliberate insult to him,but <entidade " Edmure Tully"> Edmure Tully</entidade> points out that <entidade " Frey"> Frey</entidade> is getting the wedding he wanted ; his sister counters that he is getting a wedding,but not the one he wanted,glaring at her son and his wife as she says so,pointing out that <entidade " Frey"> Frey</entidade> wanted one of his daughters wed to a king.
<entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb</entidade> retorts that Edmure is the best match <entidade " House Frey"> House Frey</entidade> has been offered in its history.
Later that night,as <entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb</entidade> and <entidade " Talisa"> Talisa</entidade> prepare for bed,she tells him she is pregnant with his child.
<entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb</entidade> is gladdened by the news.
At his prison,<entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon Greyjoy</entidade> is released from the cross to which he is chained by two beautiful girls.
The women lay <entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon</entidade> down on a bed and then proceed to dramatically seduce him.
They say repeatedly that they have heard that the heir to <entidade " Pyke"> Pyke</entidade> is well endowed and are hoping to get first hand experience.
Theon is distrustful at first,fearing that this is another of his tormenter's tricks.
Theon can not help himself but be aroused when one of the women who has become naked straddles him and begins a rocking motion.
Suddenly,the familiar horn sounds and the boy enters.
Theon is terrified and tries to escape,but is struck hard on the head and is flung to the ground.
The boy claims he too has heard about <entidade " Theon's"> Theon's</entidade> famous body part and announces it must very well be his favorite body part.
When the sadistic youth brandishes an odd knife,<entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon</entidade> realizes the boy means to remove his penis.
<entidade " Horrified"> Horrified</entidade>,<entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon</entidade> begs for mercy,but the boy quips that this is mercy as he's not killing <entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon</entidade>,merely altering him.
Two large men hold a screaming <entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon</entidade> down while the boy moves in to castrate him.
At <entidade " King's Landing"> King's Landing</entidade>,neither <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> or <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> are particularly happy about their impending marriage.
<entidade " Margaery Tyrell"> Margaery Tyrell</entidade> consoles <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade>,reminding her that Tyrion is far from the worst Lannister and that Tyrion might be able to make her happy,given his skill as a lover.
<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade>,meanwhile,points out to Tyrion that he can easily wed <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> and get a son and heir from her to placate his father and keep having sex with <entidade " Shae"> Shae</entidade> in private,thereby getting two women and a kingdom to rule for himself.
However,<entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> is concerned his mistress isn't going to be so willing to go along with that plan and is less than enthusiastic about having a wife,a mistress and the entire <entidade " North"> North</entidade> despising him.
<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> points out that Tyrion is wasting his time trying to be universally loved.
Tyrion's fears prove accurate as <entidade " Shae"> Shae</entidade> bluntly tells him that she will no longer sleep with him after he weds <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade>.
Meanwhile,<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin Lannister</entidade> enters the throne room to answer a summons from King <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade>.
After exchanging some false courtesy <entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> asks why his grandson wished to see him.
<entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> wants an update on what the <entidade " Small Council"> Small Council</entidade> has been doing.
Tywin informs Joffrey that the king can attend any <entidade " Small Council"> Small Council</entidade> meeting should he desire it.
The boy king claims that he is too busy to attend said meetings and demands to know why the location of the council meetings has changed.
<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> says that he is holding the meeting in the <entidade " Tower of the Hand"> Tower of the Hand</entidade> to save time.
When <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> complains that he would have to climb too many steps should he wish to sit in on a small council meeting,<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> silently ascends the steps to stand next to the throne,silently glares down at <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade>,and then sardonically says he could arrange to have <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> carried.
A disconcerted <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> changes the subject to <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> ; <entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> is surprised that <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> even knows about the exiled princess.
<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> admits the reports are apparently true that the last <entidade " Targaryen"> Targaryen</entidade> is not only alive,but has successfully hatched the first live dragons the world has seen in almost two centuries.
<entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> is puzzled at why <entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> doesn't think they should do anything about her,but <entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> reminds <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> that the last Targaryen dragons were stunted inbred creatures who weren't a threat to anyone,and <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade>' dragons are probably just curiosities at best,not grand weapons of war.
Moreover,<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> says that even if <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade>' dragons do turn out to be as strong as the dragons of centuries long ago,they are on the far side of the world and no threat to <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade>'s rule.
<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> also warns his grandson that he should heed his advisor's council on matters he does not comprehend.
When <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> protests that he hasn't been counseled on anything,<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> says he is being advised at this very moment and says that he will inform <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> should he deem it necessary.
Before taking his leave <entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> smiles slightly with an even slighter bow leaving a browbeaten <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> squirming on the <entidade " Iron Throne"> Iron Throne</entidade>.
Their exchange leaves no doubt as to who is really ruling the kingdom.
At <entidade " Harrenhal"> Harrenhal</entidade>,<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> speaks one last time to <entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade> before he leaves.
<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> remarks that he owes <entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade> a debt for both keeping him alive on their journey and for giving him a reason to live to rouse him from his suicidal depression after losing his hand.
<entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade> tells <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> to repay his debt by keeping his pledge.
<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> promises that he will keep his word to return <entidade " Catelyn Stark"> Catelyn Stark</entidade>'s daughters to her.
The next day,<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> leaves <entidade " Harrenhal"> Harrenhal</entidade> in the company of <entidade " Qyburn"> Qyburn</entidade> ( who is to accompany <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> to continue treating his arm in the hopes of getting his <entidade " Maester"> Maester</entidade>'s chain restored through <entidade " Lord Tywin"> Lord Tywin</entidade>'s influence- <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> jokes that his father will make <entidade " Qyburn Grand Maester"> Qyburn Grand Maester</entidade> if he grows <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> a new hand ) and a number of <entidade " Bolton"> Bolton</entidade> soldiers under the command of <entidade " Steelshanks"> Steelshanks</entidade>,one of <entidade " Lord Bolton's"> Lord Bolton's</entidade> captains.
<entidade " Lord Roose Bolton"> Lord Roose Bolton</entidade>,who is also about to depart  Harrenhal for the Twins,under orders from <entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb Stark</entidade>,requests that <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> pass on his regards to <entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> ; <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> asks that <entidade " Bolton"> Bolton</entidade> do the same for him with <entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb</entidade>.
<entidade " Locke"> Locke</entidade>,who has been left in charge of the castle in <entidade " Bolton"> Bolton</entidade>'s absence,can't resist poking fun at the departing <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> and sneers that he will'take good care' of <entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade>,though <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> doesn't rise to the bait.
When their party makes camp,as <entidade " Qyburn Grand Maester"> Qyburn</entidade> checks <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade>'s stump,<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> questions how the former Maester lost his chain.
Qyburn explains that he lost it for performing vivisections on the sick and dying in a bid to better understand illness.
<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> is disgusted by this revelation,but <entidade " Qyburn Grand Maester"> Qyburn</entidade> counters what he learned has saved numerous more lives and questions <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> on how many he has killed compared to how many he's saved.
<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> responds that he has probably killed thousands,but he saved half a million lives when he killed the <entidade " Mad King"> Mad King</entidade> to save the population of <entidade " King's Landing"> King's Landing</entidade>,much to <entidade " Qyburn Grand Maester"> Qyburn</entidade>'s surprise.
<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> then asks about <entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade> ; <entidade " Qyburn Grand Maester"> Qyburn</entidade> confirms that they sent a raven to her father,<entidade " Lord Selwyn Tarth"> Lord Selwyn Tarth</entidade>,and he offered a ransom of 300 <entidade " Gold Dragons"> Gold Dragons</entidade> for his daughter's safe return.
However,<entidade " Locke"> Locke</entidade> refused the offer ; still under the misapprehension that <entidade " Tarth"> Tarth</entidade> owns every sapphire mine in <entidade " Westeros"> Westeros</entidade>,<entidade " Locke"> Locke</entidade> is convinced <entidade " Lord Selwyn Tarth"> Lord Selwyn</entidade> is trying to cheat him.
When <entidade " Qyburn Grand Maester"> Qyburn</entidade> mentions that most of the men would rather get some meager entertainment out of killing <entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade> before they die in battle or winter,<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade>,feeling guilty because his lie to protect <entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade> has invertantly placed her in greater danger,urges <entidade " Steelshanks"> Steelshanks</entidade> to return to <entidade " Harrenhal"> Harrenhal</entidade>.
Though the man initially refuses,<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> uses the promise of a reward and the threat of <entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin Lannister</entidade>'s retribution to convince him to go back.
Upon arriving at <entidade " Harrenhal"> Harrenhal</entidade>,<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> is shocked and furious to find <entidade " Locke"> Locke</entidade> and his cronies have thrown <entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade> into a bear pit,facing an angry bear with only a wooden sword to defend herself,as they all mockingly sing The <entidade " Bear"> Bear</entidade> and the <entidade " Maiden Fair"> Maiden Fair</entidade>.
Jaime orders <entidade " Locke"> Locke</entidade> to pull her out and offers to pay whatever ransom he wants,but <entidade " Locke"> Locke</entidade> dismisses the offer,getting more satisfaction out of the spectacle of <entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade> being torn apart.
In desperation,<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> leaps into the pit to help her ; before the bear can harm either of them,<entidade " Steelshanks"> Steelshanks</entidade> shoots it with a crossbow,distracting the beast long enough for <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> and <entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade> to be pulled out of the pit.
<entidade " Locke"> Locke</entidade> tries to stop them from leaving,but <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> angrily tells him that <entidade " Lord Bolton's"> Lord Bolton</entidade> cares more about getting him back to <entidade " King's Landing"> King's Landing</entidade> alive than keeping one of his pet thugs happy,and backed up by Steelshanks and his men,<entidade " Locke"> Locke</entidade> is unable to stop them.
Jaime then departs <entidade " Harrenhal"> Harrenhal</entidade> with his escort and <entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade> in tow.
