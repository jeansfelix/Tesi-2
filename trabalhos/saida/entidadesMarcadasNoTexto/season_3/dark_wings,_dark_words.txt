<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Snow</entidade> learns about wargs from the <entidade "Free Folk">Free Folk</entidade>.
<entidade "Bran Stark">Bran Stark</entidade> is surprised to meet new allies in the barren <entidade "North">North</entidade>.

Beyond the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> 
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Snow</entidade> marches slowly South with the Free Folk army of <entidade "King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder">King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder</entidade>.
Mance explains that his army is a diverse force,formed of about ninety different groups or clans of wildlings,who speak seven different languages,and have numerous internal rivalries.
However,he managed to unite them all by telling them the truth : that they will all die if they remain north of the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade>.
<entidade "Mance">Mance</entidade> brings <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> to one of his scouts,<entidade "Orell">Orell</entidade>.
He is sitting silently with his eyes rolled back as an eagle circles above him.
<entidade "Mance">Mance</entidade> says that he is a warg,and <entidade "Ygritte">Ygritte</entidade> is surprised that <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> doesn't know what that is.
Mance explains that a warg is a person who is capable of entering the mind of an animal,seeing what it sees and even controlling its actions.
<entidade "Orell">Orell</entidade> controls his menagerie to scout miles ahead.
<entidade "Mance">Mance</entidade> asks him what he has seen,and <entidade "Orell">Orell</entidade> says he saw the <entidade "Fist of the First Men">Fist of the First Men</entidade> - and many dead crows.

<entidade "Mormont">Mormont</entidade> assigns <entidade "Rast">Rast</entidade> care of <entidade "Tarly">Tarly</entidade>.
<entidade "Lord Commander Jeor Mormont of the Night">Lord Commander Jeor Mormont of the Night</entidade>'s <entidade "Watch">Watch</entidade> leads the few survivors of the slaughter at the <entidade "Battle of the Fist of the First Men">Battle of the Fist of the First Men</entidade> south in hope of reaching the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade>.
<entidade "Samwell Tarly">Samwell Tarly</entidade> is exhausted and collapses.
<entidade "Rast">Rast</entidade> is annoyed that <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> hid during the battle,and thinks they should leave him because he's slowing them down.
<entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> is upset that <entidade "Grenn">Grenn</entidade> and <entidade "Edd">Edd</entidade> abandoned him at the start of the attack,although they refuse to leave him now.
<entidade "Mormont">Mormont</entidade> tells <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> that he has to keep moving,and sternly forbids <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> to die.
<entidade "Mormont">Mormont</entidade> orders <entidade "Rast">Rast</entidade> to keep <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> alive until they reach the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> on pain of death.

In the <entidade "Seven Kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</entidade> 
<entidade "Bran Stark">Bran Stark</entidade> dreams that he is walking and hunting in the woods ; he sees the mysterious three-eyed raven again.
As he aims his bow,he relives his memories of when he was practicing archery with <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> and <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>,and hears the voice of his father <entidade "Eddard">Eddard</entidade>.
<entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> shoots at the raven but misses.
A young stranger appears.
The boy tells <entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> that he can not shoot the raven,because he is the raven.
<entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> awakens suddenly,worrying <entidade "Hodor">Hodor</entidade> for a moment but he says that he is fine.
<entidade "Osha">Osha</entidade> says they have enough problems without dark dreams.
<entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade>,<entidade "Rickon">Rickon</entidade>,<entidade "Osha">Osha</entidade>,<entidade "Hodor">Hodor</entidade>,and the direwolves <entidade "Summer">Summer</entidade> and <entidade "Shaggydog">Shaggydog</entidade> continue to head north from <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade> to the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade>.
Later,the same boy from the dream approaches their camp in the woods unarmed.
Summer snarls at him initially but then sniffs his hand and turns away.
Osha comes up behind the boy with a sharpened wooden spear,only for the boy's sister to surprise <entidade "Osha">Osha</entidade> and put a knife to her throat.
The boy introduces himself as <entidade "Jojen Reed">Jojen Reed</entidade>,and his sister as <entidade "Meera Reed">Meera Reed</entidade>.
<entidade "House Reed">House Reed</entidade> are loyal bannermen of <entidade "House Stark">House Stark</entidade>,and they have been searching for <entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> and <entidade "Rickon">Rickon</entidade> so that they can protect them.
When they are on the move again,<entidade "Jojen Reed">Jojen</entidade> and <entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> discuss his wolf-dreams.
<entidade "Jojen Reed">Jojen</entidade> explains that <entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> himself is a warg.
<entidade "Jojen Reed">Jojen</entidade> says that it starts out as vivid dreams seeing the world through his wolf's eyes,but with practice he will be able to consciously enter the mind of his wolf and control its actions.
<entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> asks if prophetic dreams are part of being a warg,but <entidade "Jojen Reed">Jojen</entidade> explains that's a different,related ability.
The <entidade "Sight">Sight</entidade> allows those who possess it to see events that haven't happened yet,or events that happened long before they were born,or events happening now but thousands of miles away.
Jojen confirms that <entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade>'s dream of his father <entidade "Eddard">Eddard</entidade> the day he died was an example of the <entidade "Sight">Sight</entidade>,and that <entidade "Jojen Reed">Jojen</entidade> himself had a similar dream the same day.
He says that when he told his father,<entidade "Howland Reed">Lord Howland Reed</entidade>,he openly wept,for he correctly realized that his son's dream signified that <entidade "Eddard">Eddard</entidade> was dead.
<entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> says that <entidade "Howland Reed">Howland</entidade> was a great friend of his father <entidade "Eddard">Eddard</entidade>'s who fought alongside him during <entidade "Robert's Rebellion">Robert's Rebellion</entidade>.
<entidade "Jojen Reed">Jojen</entidade> says that <entidade "Howland Reed">Howland</entidade> doesn't like to talk about the war much.
Jojen confirms that <entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> wasn't simply experiencing a vision of <entidade "Jojen Reed">Jojen</entidade> in his earlier dream,but that he reached out with his mind to contact <entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> in his dream,and that he remembers seeing the three-eyed raven too.
At an indeterminate location,<entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon Greyjoy</entidade> has been chained up in a dungeon after being knocked out before the <entidade "Sack of Winterfell">Sack of Winterfell</entidade>.
Men come in,some wearing ironborn clothing,and interrogate him.
When he asks what they want,one of his captors says he wants to do this and starts prying his fingernails off with a knife.
Later they use a foot press to torture him,while also slowly turning a screw into his foot until it is bleeding freely,repeatedly asking him why he captured <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade>,but apparently not caring about the answers he gives.
Theon at first tells them the simple truth that he wanted to take and hold Winterfell while the North was vunerable to impress his father,then starts frantically lying,saying he hates the <entidade "Starks">Starks</entidade> and is their enemy,desperately trying to figure out what his captors want him to tell them.
When the guards leave they put a bag over his head.
A servant boy comes over to <entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon</entidade> and unwinds the foot press,and tells him that he has been sent by his sister <entidade "Yara">Yara</entidade> to rescue him.
However,he must wait until nightfall when the castle is asleep,so he puts the bag back on and the desperate <entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon</entidade> is left alone crying for help.
King <entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey Baratheon</entidade> is being fitted for new clothes in his chambers,in preparation for his upcoming wedding to <entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery Tyrell</entidade>.
His mother <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> begins to criticize <entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade>,saying that she is only charitable to the poor to build up support for herself,and also saying that she thinks she dresses like a harlot.
However,<entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade> barely tolerates his mother's chiding and dismissively tells her off.

<entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade> dresses <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa Stark</entidade> in her chambers,and warns Sansa about Petyr Littlefinger Baelish.
She points out that <entidade "Baelish">Baelish</entidade> has offered to help <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> for nothing in return,which probably means that he's after something.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> naively says that he's an old friend of her mother's,believing that should be reason enough.
<entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade> suggests that <entidade "Baelish">Baelish</entidade> is actually sexually attracted to <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade>.
This disturbs <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade>,but she thinks it is simply impossible,as <entidade "Baelish">Baelish</entidade> is so much older than her.
<entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade> continues to warn Sansa that Baelish is manipulative and men usually only want one thing from pretty young ladies,and love often isn't what they're after.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> warns the Tyrells that Joffrey is a monster.
<entidade "Loras Tyrell">Ser Loras Tyrell</entidade> arrives at the door and escorts <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> to the gardens to meet with <entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade> and their grandmother,<entidade "Lady Olenna Tyrell">Lady Olenna Tyrell</entidade>.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> reminds <entidade "Loras Tyrell">Loras</entidade> that they met once before at the <entidade "Tourney of the Hand">Tourney of the Hand</entidade>,and he takes his leave after introducing her.
Lady <entidade "Olenna">Olenna</entidade> is a cunning and intelligent woman who speaks her mind,and bluntly says that her son <entidade "Mace">Mace</entidade> was a fool for supporting <entidade "Renly Baratheon">Renly Baratheon</entidade>'s claim to the throne,though <entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade> speaks well of <entidade "Renly Baratheon">Renly</entidade>.
Lady <entidade "Olenna">Olenna</entidade> insists that <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> tell her the truth about what <entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade> is like,as he is to marry <entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade>.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> is initially reluctant,but when <entidade "Olenna">Olenna</entidade> mentions her father,<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> breaks down and,her eyes blazing,angrily recounts how <entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade> had said he would show her father mercy,only to behead him in front of her,and how he then took her up to the wall and forced her to look at her father's head on a spike and claim him providing her father with a swift death was mercy.
Realizing what she has just been saying,<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> nervously attempts to backtrack.
<entidade "Olenna">Olenna</entidade> continues to prod <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> as she fidgets around,and it becomes obvious that she is visibly afraid about being overheard.
After enough times of <entidade "Olenna">Olenna</entidade> insisting that she can trust her not to repeat what she says,<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> blurts out that <entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade> is a monster.
<entidade "Olenna">Olenna</entidade> is disappointed,but unsurprised,given the rumors that have been circulating about <entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade>'s public outbursts.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> is worried that this means the <entidade "Tyrells">Tyrells</entidade> will cancel their proposed marriage alliance ( meaning <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> will be stuck with <entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade> again ),but <entidade "Olenna">Olenna</entidade> assures her that her son <entidade "Mace">Mace</entidade> is too intent on <entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade> entering into a royal marriage to cancel it for anything.
<entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade> sneaks into <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</entidade>'s new chambers.
He warns her that his father threatened to kill her if he found her with him again,and that his father follows through on such threats.
<entidade "Undeterred">Undeterred</entidade>,<entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade> starts undressing <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade>,and asks him for a favor ; to protect Sansa from Baelish.
Tyrion says that he no longer has enough power or influence to attempt to do that,though <entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade> accuses him of being attracted to <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade>,which he cheerfully denies.
It also comes out that <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> had sex with <entidade "Ros">Ros</entidade> back in the <entidade "North">North</entidade>,though <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> points out it was before he met <entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade>.
They playfully bicker about it as they start having sex.

<entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade> finds a way to bond with <entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade>.
<entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade> is summoned to <entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade>'s chambers to see if she needs anything before he leaves on a hunting trip.
While <entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade> has previously been easy for <entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade> to manipulate,<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> was apparently able to plant one seed of doubt in his mind ; the fact that <entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade> was married to his uncle <entidade "Renly Baratheon">Renly</entidade> ( and thus,already had sex with another man ),whom <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> described as a traitor and known degenerate.
When questioned,<entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade> says that she was ordered to marry a traitor as her family duty,but <entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade> implies that this still means he must have had sex with her.
<entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade> angrily questions Margaery about the relationship and she delicately placates him by feigning demure shyness and painting herself as a dutiful,but frustrated,bride.
She uses the rumors about <entidade "Renly Baratheon">Renly</entidade>'s homosexuality to redirect <entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade>'s anger,stating that <entidade "Renly Baratheon">Renly</entidade> always found excuses to avoid sex,but,in one instance,drunkenly suggested something that sounded very painful and could not possibly result in children,which draws her new fiance's sympathy.
<entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade> eventually manages to divert attention to the new custom crossbow <entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade>'s had made for his excursion.
It quickly becomes apparent that <entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade> is excited by violence and sadism,so she flirts with him by complimenting the crossbow and musing about killing something herself.
Easily played,<entidade "Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</entidade> offers to take her with him to share in the excitement of killing something.
King <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb Stark</entidade> settles into the council chamber at <entidade "Harrenhal">Harrenhal</entidade> with his wife <entidade "Talisa">Queen Talisa</entidade>.
<entidade "Roose Bolton">Lord Roose Bolton</entidade> interrupts them with two messenger-raven missives,each of which brings bad news.
First,<entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade>'s maternal grandfather <entidade "Hoster Tully">Hoster Tully</entidade> has finally died after a long illness at his castle of <entidade "Riverrun">Riverrun</entidade>.
Second,<entidade "Roose Bolton">Roose</entidade> delivers a letter from his bastard son <entidade "Ramsay Snow">Ramsay Snow</entidade>,stating that the ironborn torched <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade> and put all of its inhabitants to the sword,and then fled all before his force arrived there.
There has been no sighting of <entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> or <entidade "Rickon">Rickon</entidade>,and though <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade> hopes that they are still alive,there is a strong possibility that they are dead.
Moreover,there has been no word of <entidade "Theon Greyjoy">Theon</entidade>,and if he took the boys captive the <entidade "Greyjoys">Greyjoys</entidade> haven't sent out any demands.
This double-blow reduces <entidade "Catelyn Stark">Catelyn Stark</entidade> to tears and she laments that she had not seen her father in years.
She is horrified at the thought that <entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> and <entidade "Rickon">Rickon</entidade> were in danger while she was away and could not protect them,and are now likely dead.
<entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade> leaves <entidade "Roose Bolton">Roose</entidade> in command of <entidade "Harrenhal">Harrenhal</entidade> with a detachment of the <entidade "Northern">Northern</entidade> army while <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade> leads his main host back across the <entidade "Riverlands">Riverlands</entidade> to <entidade "Riverrun">Riverrun</entidade>.
<entidade "Rickard Karstark">Lord Rickard Karstark</entidade> angrily says that this is a waste of time,though <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade> points out that <entidade "Catelyn Stark">Catelyn</entidade>'s brother and his uncle,<entidade "Edmure Tully">Edmure Tully</entidade>,is now lord of <entidade "Riverrun">Riverrun</entidade> and his levies will reinforce their army.
<entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade> maintains that unless <entidade "Edmure Tully">Edmure</entidade> has been breeding soldiers like rabbits,it will make no difference : with their new <entidade "Tyrells">Tyrell</entidade> allies,the Lannisters now outnumber them over two to one.
<entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade> asks if <entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade> has lost faith in their cause,and <entidade "Karstark">Karstark</entidade> says he still believes in revenge.
However,the fact that <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade> lost his home castle makes him seem vulnerable in the eyes of his bannermen,and many no longer believe in <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade> as they once did.
<entidade "Karstark">Lord Karstark</entidade> asks to speak his mind ( as if he wasn't already ),and says that he thinks <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade> lost the war the day he married <entidade "Talisa">Talisa</entidade>,a political nobody,throwing away any opportunity to forge marriage-alliances with badly needed allies,specifically breaking his promise to enter into a marriage-alliance with <entidade "House Frey">House Frey</entidade>.
<entidade "Talisa">Talisa</entidade> notices that <entidade "Catelyn Stark">Catelyn</entidade> is making a prayer wheel for the <entidade "Faith of the Seven">Faith of the Seven</entidade>,and offers to help.
<entidade "Catelyn Stark">Catelyn</entidade> explains that they can only be made by mothers who are praying for the welfare of their children.
Catelyn reveals that she has only made them twice before,one of which was when she was praying for <entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> to wake from his coma,which worked after a fashion,as he did survive though he lost the use of his legs.
<entidade "Talisa">Talisa</entidade> asks after the other time,and <entidade "Catelyn Stark">Catelyn</entidade> says that when they were younger,one of the boys had a pox,and <entidade "Luwin">Maester Luwin</entidade> said that if he survived the night he would be all right,but that it would be a long night.
<entidade "Catelyn Stark">Catelyn</entidade> explains that the boy was <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Snow</entidade>,and at first the thought that <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> would conveniently die of natural causes made her inwardly pray to the <entidade "Seven">Seven</entidade> for his end.
However,<entidade "Catelyn Stark">Catelyn</entidade> then became horrified at herself for thinking such a thing,particularly as <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> was an innocent child,and the person <entidade "Catelyn Stark">Catelyn</entidade> really hated was <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade>'s unidentified mother.
So she made a prayer wheel and stayed up with him all night,praying to the gods that if they forgave her earlier wish that <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> would die,she promised she would urge <entidade "Eddard">Eddard</entidade> to have <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> legitimized as a <entidade "Stark">Stark</entidade> and she would raise him as her own son.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> recovered,however,<entidade "Catelyn Stark">Catelyn</entidade> did not keep her promise.
In grief at the death of her father and apparent death of her two youngest sons,and her continued grief at losing <entidade "Eddard">Eddard</entidade>,<entidade "Catelyn Stark">Catelyn</entidade> says the gods are punishing her misconduct with this war.
Not too far away in the <entidade "Riverlands">Riverlands</entidade>,<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya Stark</entidade>,<entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade>,and <entidade "Hot Pie">Hot Pie</entidade> are heading north from <entidade "Harrenhal">Harrenhal</entidade>,planning to eventually reach the <entidade "Red Fork of the Trident River">Red Fork of the Trident River</entidade> and then follow it west to her grandfather's castle-seat at <entidade "Riverrun">Riverrun</entidade>.
Off-screen,<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> explained to the boys how <entidade "Jaqen H'ghar">Jaqen H'ghar</entidade> helped them escape because he offered that he would kill any three people she named.
<entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade> loudly criticizes <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade>,in disbelief that she used up two of the names on minor <entidade "Lannister">Lannister</entidade> guards when she could have said someone like <entidade "King Joffrey">King Joffrey</entidade> or <entidade "Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</entidade> and ended the entire war,at which <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> gets quite defensive.
However,as they advance in the forest,they run into a scouting party of the <entidade "Brotherhood Without Banners">Brotherhood Without Banners</entidade>,a group of outlaws,whose leader <entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros of Myr</entidade> they hear singing The <entidade "Rains of Castamere">Rains of Castamere</entidade> as they approach.
They recognize them as the group the <entidade "Lannister">Lannister</entidade> torturers were asking about at <entidade "Harrenhal">Harrenhal</entidade>.
<entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros</entidade> seems a friendly sort,and they make the children come with them.
They later give them food and drink at a local inn.
<entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade> says he used to work as a smith in <entidade "King Joffrey">King</entidade>'s Landing for Tobho Mott,whom <entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros</entidade> recognizes but says he charged double what the other smiths did ; <entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade> counters that's because it was double the quality.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> insists that she knows how to use a sword despite <entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros</entidade>' disbelief,but when she tries to mock-fence with him he quickly disarms her.
Other members of the <entidade "Brotherhood Without Banners">Brotherhood</entidade> return to the inn with a captive ; <entidade "Sandor">Sandor</entidade> The <entidade "Hound Clegane">Hound Clegane</entidade>.
As <entidade "Thoros of Myr">Thoros</entidade> trades insults with <entidade "Sandor">Sandor</entidade>,<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> tries to leave,but the <entidade "Hound Clegane">Hound</entidade> stops her in astonishment and asks what in seven hells they're doing with the <entidade "Stark">Stark</entidade> bitch,revealing her identity to all.
Finally,<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</entidade> and <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne of Tarth</entidade> are slowly making their way across country through the <entidade "Riverlands">Riverlands</entidade>,heading to <entidade "King Joffrey">King</entidade>'s Landing intending to make the prisoner exchange for the <entidade "Stark">Stark</entidade> girls ( really,just <entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> ).
Jaime continues to mock <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> along the way.
<entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> is wary enough not to let <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> out of her sight,even insisting on keeping him on his leash and watching while he urinates so he doesn't slip away.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> deduces that <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> isn't from the <entidade "North">North</entidade> because he would have noticed her at <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade> when he visited there,so ( as she is from <entidade "House Tarth">House Tarth</entidade> ) she must be a <entidade "Baratheon">Baratheon</entidade> supporter.
She angrily denies supporting <entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade>,thus confirming that she served Renly.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> accurately deduces that she fancied Renly,but points out that <entidade "Renly">Renly</entidade> wasn't attracted to women so much as he was to <entidade "Loras">Loras</entidade>.
<entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> says she doesn't want to hear his filthy lies,but he says that he knew Renly better than she did,reminding her that both of them spent the last 17 years living in the <entidade "Red Keep">Red Keep</entidade>,ever since <entidade "Robert">Robert</entidade>'s Rebellion when <entidade "Renly">Renly</entidade> was just a child prancing down the halls.
Jaime insists that <entidade "Renly">Renly</entidade>'s homosexuality was actually the worst kept secret at court if she thinks he's lying.
He continues to casually <entidade "mock Renly">mock Renly</entidade> which makes <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> grab him,but he relents and says he doesn't particularly care that Renly loved <entidade "Loras">Loras</entidade>,as he feels people aren't free to choose the ones they love ( which he knows better than most ).
They come across a farmer with a heavily laden mule,who notices that they're cutting cross-country and avoiding the major roads,and suspects that they're avoiding soldiers.
