<entidade " Dany"> Dany</entidade> commands him and several <entidade " Unsullied"> Unsullied</entidade> to infiltrate <entidade " Meereen"> Meereen</entidade> disguised as slaves and convince the slaves to rise against their masters.
They visit a slave pen,where a number of slaves are discussing whether or not to rise against the Great <entidade " Masters"> Masters</entidade>.
One of the young slaves is already trying to convince his fellow men in chains to fight,but the older slaves argue they have no means to oppose their Masters,who have squashed every previous slave rebellion.

The cries of the crucified <entidade " Great Masters"> Great Masters</entidade> reach <entidade " Dany"> Dany</entidade>'s ears atop <entidade " Meereen"> Meereen</entidade>'s tallest pyramid,where the city's emblem,the golden harpy of <entidade " Ghis"> Ghis</entidade>,has been draped in the banner of <entidade " House Targaryen"> House Targaryen</entidade>.
Now,she has conquered all three of the cities on <entidade " Slaver's Bay"> Slaver's Bay</entidade>.

At the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> 
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon Snow</entidade> and <entidade " Grenn"> Grenn</entidade> are teaching several recruits,including <entidade " Locke"> Locke</entidade> and <entidade " Olly"> Olly</entidade>,how to fight against wildlings.
<entidade " Alliser Thorne"> Alliser Thorne</entidade> admonishes <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> and reminds him that he is a steward,not a ranger,trying to provoke <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> in an excuse to have him killed.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> leaves the yard and talks with <entidade " Locke"> Locke</entidade>,who pretends he is from the <entidade " Stormlands"> Stormlands</entidade> and genuinely wants to protect the realm.
<entidade " Janos Slynt"> Janos Slynt</entidade> points out to Thorne that <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> is well liked and <entidade " Thorne"> Thorne</entidade> is not,and when <entidade " Maester Aemon"> Maester Aemon</entidade> insists upon an election for a new <entidade " Lord Commander"> Lord Commander</entidade>,<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> is far more likely to succeed <entidade " Mormont"> Mormont</entidade>.
<entidade " Slynt"> Slynt</entidade> convinces <entidade " Thorne"> Thorne</entidade> to allow <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> to deal with the mutineers,in the hope that they will remove him from the problem.
Meanwhile,<entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Samwell Tarly</entidade> is fretting about <entidade " Gilly"> Gilly</entidade>'s safety in <entidade " Mole's Town"> Mole's Town</entidade> with the wildlings loose,and it is revealed that <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> told  Jon about Bran still being alive and north of the wall.
<entidade " Locke"> Locke</entidade> brings <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> to <entidade " Thorne"> Thorne</entidade>,who sanctions his mission but tells <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> that he must secure volunteers rather than have men ordered along with him.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> gives an impassioned speech,insisting that not only must the mutineers be dealt with for <entidade " Castle Black"> Castle Black</entidade>'s safety,but <entidade " Lord Commander Mormont"> Lord Commander Mormont</entidade> deserves justice.

At <entidade " King"> King</entidade>'s Landing 
During their sword training,<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> implores <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> to visit his brother Tyrion in the dungeon,saying that <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> named <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> his champion in The <entidade " Eyrie"> Eyrie</entidade> because he knew <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> would ride day and night to fight for him.
<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> finally visits <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade>,confessing that <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> asked him to murder him.
Convincing Jaime that he didn't kill <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade>,<entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> notes that not even an irrefutable confession by the real perpetrator would satisfy <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade>.
She is out for <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade>'s blood,and he says that the trial is even worse because at least one judge has always wanted him dead.
<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> tells  Tyrion that Cersei offers a knighthood to whomever captures <entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa Stark</entidade>.
Tyrion insists that <entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade> had nothing to do with the murder,despite having the best motive.
Later,<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> visits <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade>,who is disgusted that,in her view,<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> is taking <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade>'s side because of his long-held affection for their brother.
Meanwhile,<entidade " Lady Olenna"> Lady Olenna</entidade> tells <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> that she is about to leave for <entidade " Highgarden"> Highgarden</entidade>.
She mentions the new and prospective marriage between <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> and the new king,<entidade " Tommen"> Tommen</entidade>.
She insists that <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> will turn  Tommen against Margaery by the time they marry if <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> doesn't act fast.
Fortunately,<entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> is well distracted by accusing her innocent brother of the murder of her son.
Margaery insists that <entidade " Olenna"> Olenna</entidade> can not be certain of <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade>'s innocence,but <entidade " Olenna"> Olenna</entidade> states that <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> certainly is innocent and confesses that she would never have let <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> marry that beast.
<entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> is shocked but her grandmother firmly ends the conversation.
That night,<entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> enters <entidade " Tommen"> Tommen</entidade>'s chambers,slipping past the <entidade " Kingsguard"> Kingsguard</entidade> and charming <entidade " Tommen"> Tommen</entidade>.
She puts in his mind the idea that one day she will be his and they might as well learn to like each other,and compliments him on his cat and kind demeanour.
She promises to visit again and <entidade " Tommen"> Tommen</entidade> falls asleep smiling.
In the chambers of the <entidade " Kingsguard"> Kingsguard</entidade>,<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> tasks <entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade> with finding <entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade>.
He urges her to find and keep the girl safe from those who would hand her over to <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> and provides her with a horse,supplies,and a freshly forged suit of armor.
Jaime then gifts her with the sword his father gave him,saying that the Valyrian steel is forged from <entidade " Ned Stark"> Ned Stark</entidade>'s sword and that the steel from <entidade " Ned Stark"> Ned Stark</entidade>'s sword should be used to defend <entidade " Ned Stark"> Ned Stark</entidade>'s daughters.
He also insists she take <entidade " Podrick Payne"> Podrick Payne</entidade> with her as a squire,both as a reward for the boy's service to <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> and to keep him safe from those who would seek to use him against his former master.
Before departing,<entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade> names the sword <entidade " Oathkeeper"> Oathkeeper</entidade> and vows to find <entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade>,for the sake of <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> and <entidade " Lady Catelyn"> Lady Catelyn</entidade>.

<entidade " En"> En</entidade> route to the <entidade " Vale"> Vale</entidade> 
<entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade> accuses <entidade " Petyr Baelish"> Petyr Baelish</entidade> of having <entidade " Joffrey Baratheon"> Joffrey Baratheon</entidade> murdered.
At first <entidade " Baelish"> Baelish</entidade> evades the accusation,pointing out that he has been away for weeks and that <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> could be the perpetrator.
<entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade> defends <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade>,with an innate certainty that he is innocent,and mentions that <entidade " Baelish"> Baelish</entidade> is far too smart to trust a drunk with the scheme.
Impressed with her instincts,<entidade " Baelish"> Baelish</entidade> admits that Tyrion is in fact innocent,and reveals <entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade>'s own part in <entidade " Joffrey Baratheon"> Joffrey</entidade>'s death - <entidade " Ser Dontos"> Ser Dontos</entidade>' necklace was in fact the murder weapon,and someone slipped a stone ( which was poisonous ) into <entidade " Joffrey Baratheon"> Joffrey</entidade>'s wine.
<entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade> is bewildered,because the Lannisters have done so much for <entidade " Baelish"> Baelish</entidade>,including granting him the seat of <entidade " Harrenhal"> Harrenhal</entidade>.
Baelish confesses that while his friendship with the <entidade " Lannisters"> Lannisters</entidade> was fruitful,it is best to keep enemies confused and his absence from the wedding means that he will never be suspected.
<entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade> declares that she doesn't entirely believe him : he's too clever to poison a king just to cause confusion.
<entidade " Baelish"> Baelish</entidade> is again impressed,and confirms that <entidade " Joffrey Baratheon"> Joffrey</entidade> was simply too volatile ; a king like him as an ally was more a hindrance than a benefit.
More importantly,though,<entidade " Joffrey Baratheon"> Joffrey</entidade>'s death was something that his new friends wanted very much,and a gift is always helpful to help a new friendship grow strong.

Beyond the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> 
At <entidade " Craster's Keep"> Craster's Keep</entidade>,the mutinous deserters are still entrenched there,indulging themselves on the food stored there and raping <entidade " Craster's Keep"> Craster</entidade>'s wives.
<entidade " Karl"> Karl</entidade> drinks wine from the skull of <entidade " Jeor Mormont"> Jeor Mormont</entidade>,drunkenly bragging about himself and his skill as a hired killer back in <entidade " King"> King</entidade>'s Landing before ordering <entidade " Rast"> Rast</entidade> to feed the beast.
At the same time,one of <entidade " Craster's Keep"> Craster</entidade>'s wives enters with <entidade " Craster's Keep"> Craster</entidade>'s last son,insisting the infant must be given as a'gift to the gods.. At <entidade " Karl"> Karl</entidade>'s orders,<entidade " Rast"> Rast</entidade> leaves the infant on a patch of open ground,then deals with the beast - Ghost,who the mutineers have caged,and whom <entidade " Rast"> Rast</entidade> taunts by withholding food and water from the direwolf.
Suddenly,a snowstorm whips up and the temperature drops,causing the water <entidade " Rast"> Rast</entidade> was taunting <entidade " Ghost"> Ghost</entidade> with to freeze.
Recognizing the approach of <entidade " White Walkers"> White Walkers</entidade>,<entidade " Rast"> Rast</entidade> flees.
Nearby,<entidade " Bran Stark"> Bran Stark</entidade> and his companions hear the child's cries ; warging into <entidade " Summer"> Summer</entidade>,<entidade " Bran Stark"> Bran</entidade> goes to investigate,but <entidade " Summer"> Summer</entidade> falls into a trap just outside <entidade " Craster's Keep"> Craster's Keep</entidade>.
<entidade " Meera Reed"> Meera Reed</entidade>,sensing danger,urges them to move on,but <entidade " Bran Stark"> Bran</entidade> insists on trying to free <entidade " Ghost"> Ghost</entidade> and <entidade " Summer"> Summer</entidade> ; before they can,however,they are taken prisoner by the mutineers.
Some of the deserters amuse themselves by tormenting <entidade " Hodor"> Hodor</entidade>,while the others are taken to <entidade " Karl"> Karl</entidade>,who threatens to kill <entidade " Meera Reed"> Meera</entidade> and <entidade " Jojen"> Jojen</entidade>.
<entidade " Jojen"> Jojen</entidade> is suddenly overcome by a seizure and falls to the floor while <entidade " Meera Reed"> Meera</entidade> begs to be let go so she can help him.
<entidade " Karl"> Karl</entidade> does so when Bran reveals his true identity.

In the <entidade " Lands of Always Winter"> Lands of Always Winter</entidade> 
Somewhere in the northernmost reaches of the world,a lone <entidade " White Walkers"> White Walker</entidade> rides its undead horse towards a shattered mountain,cradling <entidade " Craster's Keep"> Craster</entidade>'s last son in its arm.
When it reaches the mountain,the <entidade " White Walkers"> White Walker</entidade> places the baby upon an altar of ice at the center of a ring of large icicles.
On the other side,a line of dark-garbed <entidade " White Walkers"> White</entidade> <entidade " Walkers"> Walkers</entidade> watch the proceedings.
After a moment,one of them strides forth and carefully picks up the wailing child,who swiftly calms.
The <entidade " White Walkers"> White Walker</entidade> presses the nail of its index finger into the baby's cheek.
The sound of cracking ice can be heard as the child's eyes turn a depthless,icy blue.
