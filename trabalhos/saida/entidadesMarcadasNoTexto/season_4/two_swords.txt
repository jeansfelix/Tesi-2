Tyrion welcomes a guest to <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade>.
At <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade>,<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Snow</entidade> finds himself unwelcome.
<entidade "Dany">Dany</entidade> is pointed to <entidade "Meereen">Meereen</entidade>,the mother of all slave cities.
<entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade> runs into an old friend.

In <entidade "King's Landing">King</entidade>'s Landing 
<entidade "Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</entidade> has the ancestral <entidade "Stark Valyrian">Stark Valyrian</entidade> steel greatsword <entidade "Ice">Ice</entidade> ( held by the Lannisters since Eddard Stark's execution ) melted down and re-forged into two smaller swords,after which he burns the wolf pelt scabbard the greatsword was held in.
He presents one to his son <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> as a gift.
<entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> is impressed,as the Lannisters have never previously owned a Valyrian steel sword.
<entidade "Tywin Lannister">Tywin</entidade> tells him he acquired the original sword from someone who no longer needed it and then commissioned a <entidade "Volantis">Volantis</entidade> blacksmith to re-forge it.
He wants Jaime to be his heir and return home to <entidade "Casterly Rock">Casterly Rock</entidade>,but <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> insists on remaining in the <entidade "Kingsguard">Kingsguard</entidade>.
Furious at <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade>'s disobedience and lack of ambition,<entidade "Tywin Lannister">Tywin</entidade> rebuffs him.
He tells Jaime to keep the sword anyway. 
Tyrion <entidade "Lannister">Lannister</entidade>,<entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade>,and <entidade "Podrick Payne">Podrick Payne</entidade> wait on a road outside the city for the arrival of <entidade "Prince Doran Martell of Dorne">Prince Doran Martell of Dorne</entidade>,who has been invited to the royal wedding.
Tyrion quizzes <entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> on the sigils of the <entidade "Dornish">Dornish</entidade> houses,none of which he knows,however <entidade "Podrick Payne">Podrick</entidade> answers perfectly.
<entidade "Blackmont">Lord Blackmont</entidade> approaches them on horseback and says <entidade "Doran">Prince Doran</entidade> is in poor health and remained at <entidade "Sunspear">Sunspear</entidade>.
<entidade "Doran">Doran</entidade>'s brother,<entidade "Oberyn">Prince Oberyn</entidade>,will be attending the wedding in his stead,and arrived before dawn.
Assigning the reception of the Dornish Lords to the <entidade "City Watch">City Watch</entidade>,<entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> says they should find <entidade "Oberyn">Oberyn</entidade> as soon as possible before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
<entidade "Oberyn">Prince Oberyn</entidade> and his bastard paramour <entidade "Ellaria Sand">Ellaria Sand</entidade> are examining prostitutes in a brothel owned by <entidade "Petyr Baelish">Petyr Baelish</entidade>,but currently managed by <entidade "Olyvar">Olyvar</entidade>,as <entidade "Baelish">Lord Baelish</entidade> is now in the <entidade "Vale">Vale</entidade>.
They choose the contortionist <entidade "Marei">Marei</entidade>,and <entidade "Oberyn">Oberyn</entidade> orders <entidade "Olyvar">Olyvar</entidade> to get undressed also.
<entidade "Oberyn">Oberyn</entidade> is infuriated when he hears men singing The <entidade "Rains of Castamere">Rains of Castamere</entidade>.
He confronts the two <entidade "Lannister">Lannister</entidade> soldiers,who insult him and <entidade "Ellaria Sand">Ellaria</entidade>.
<entidade "Oberyn">Oberyn</entidade> moves closer and chastises them for being pink little men who are far too slow on the draw rather than being golden lions.
One of the soldiers reaches for his sword,and <entidade "Oberyn">Oberyn</entidade> quickly stabs him through the wrist with a dagger and tells the other that his friend will only live if he immediately gets help.
Tyrion and <entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> enter,and <entidade "Oberyn">Oberyn</entidade> and <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> step outside to speak privately.
<entidade "Oberyn">Oberyn</entidade> says he wants revenge for the murder of his niece <entidade "Rhaenys">Rhaenys</entidade>,his nephew <entidade "Aegon">Aegon</entidade>,and the rape and murder of his sister <entidade "Elia">Elia</entidade> in the sack of <entidade "King's Landing">King</entidade>'s Landing by Lannister troops during <entidade "Robert's Rebellion">Robert's Rebellion</entidade>.
He wants <entidade "Gregor Clegane">Gregor Clegane</entidade>,who murdered <entidade "Elia">Elia</entidade>,and <entidade "Tywin Lannister">Tywin</entidade>,whom <entidade "Oberyn">Oberyn</entidade> believes gave the order for <entidade "Elia">Elia</entidade> and her children to be killed.
Tyrion,<entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade>,<entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade>,and another handmaiden are sitting in a garden.
<entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> is still distraught over the deaths of her brother and mother.
Tyrion attempts to console his wife but fails ; <entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> has heard the gruesome details of the <entidade "Red Wedding">Red Wedding</entidade>,how the corpses of her mother and brother were desecrated.
<entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> then leaves for the godswood,not to pray but because it is the only place no one talks to her.
Tyrion returns and finds <entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade> in his bed.
He scolds her because no one can find out about their relationship.
She attempts to seduce him but he resists.
She accuses him of trying to bribe her with diamonds and ship her away to the <entidade "Free">Free</entidade> <entidade "Cities">Cities</entidade>,but he doesn't know what she's talking about ( <entidade "Varys">Varys</entidade> did this acting alone ).
She angrily leaves the room but is spotted by the handmaiden,who is hiding behind a pillar.
<entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade>,<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade>,and <entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> are in <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade>'s chambers.
<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> has had a golden prosthetic hand made for <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade>,and <entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> attaches it to <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade>'s stump.
<entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> asks <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> about her symptoms,and she says they are gone.
After <entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> departs,<entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> tells her that he will stay in the <entidade "Kingsguard">Kingsguard</entidade> with one hand so he can stay close to her,then tries to kiss her,but she turns away,much to <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade>'s confusion and anger.
<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> implies that she has taken other lovers and that their relationship has changed because of his lengthy absence,a statement that clearly wounds <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade>.
The handmaiden suddenly enters and says she has important information for <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade>.
As preparations for the royal wedding continue,<entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery Tyrell</entidade> and her grandmother <entidade "Olenna">Olenna</entidade> are interrupted by <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne of Tarth</entidade>,( <entidade "Olenna">Olenna</entidade> being delighted to see the truth of the rumors about <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> ) who requests a private word with <entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade>.
<entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> tells <entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery</entidade> the truth of <entidade "Renly">Renly</entidade>'s death and vows to one day exact revenge on <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</entidade>,whom she holds responsible.
They walk past a statue of <entidade "King Joffrey">King Joffrey</entidade> standing over a dead direwolf,commemorating the victory over the northern rebellion.
Elsewhere in the <entidade "Red Keep">Red Keep</entidade>,<entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade>,<entidade "Meryn Trant">Ser Meryn Trant</entidade> and <entidade "King Joffrey">King Joffrey</entidade> discuss security at the upcoming wedding.
<entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> is clearly irked by <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade>'s arrogance as well as <entidade "Meryn Trant">Meryn</entidade>'s sycophantic agreement with the king's bragging that he is responsible for keeping the people fed ( <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> notes that this is more the doing of the <entidade "Tyrells">Tyrells</entidade> ) and claiming he singlehandedly won the war.
<entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> ( who had previously noted to his father that thousands in <entidade "King's Landing">King</entidade>'s Landing alone still want <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> dead ) points out that the war is far from won ; <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> is still alive and will probably raise fresh armies.
<entidade "Dismissive">Dismissive</entidade> of the threat posed by <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> following the <entidade "Battle of the Blackwater">Battle of the Blackwater</entidade>,<entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> leafs through the <entidade "Book of Brothers">Book of Brothers</entidade>,which details the history of the <entidade "Kingsguard">Kingsguard</entidade> and those who served in it.
He reads <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade>'s brief entry and sneers that someone must have forgotten to record all of his uncle's great deeds.
He also questions <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade>'s ability to serve in the <entidade "Kingsguard">Kingsguard</entidade> with one hand.
<entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> defensively quips that using his left hand makes for more of a challenge.
As <entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> prays alone in the godswood,she is watched by <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> and <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> ; <entidade "Brienne of Tarth">Brienne</entidade> expects <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> to uphold his oath to return <entidade "Catelyn Stark">Catelyn Stark</entidade>'s daughters in return for his freedom,but <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> counters by pointing out the situation is complicated by <entidade "Catelyn Stark">Catelyn</entidade>'s death and <entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade>'s marriage to <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade>.
As <entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> is leaving the godswood,she is approached by <entidade "Dontos Hollard">Dontos Hollard</entidade>,who thanks her for convincing <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> to spare his life and gives her what he claims to be his mother's necklace as a token of gratitude.

In the <entidade "North">North</entidade> 
Ygritte and <entidade "Tormund">Tormund</entidade> stand outside a stone ravine.
<entidade "Tormund">Tormund</entidade> chides her for failing to finish off <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Snow</entidade>.
Suddenly,their scouts signal that someone is approaching.
<entidade "Styr">Styr</entidade> and a band of <entidade "Thenn">Thenn</entidade> approach them through the ravine.
Out of earshot,<entidade "Tormund">Tormund</entidade> comments about how much he hates <entidade "Thenns">Thenns</entidade>.
<entidade "Styr">Styr</entidade> says his party raided a village south of the ravine and gathered meat.
He says the meat tastes so much better south of the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade>,and chides <entidade "Tormund">Tormund</entidade> for losing their warg as well as <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade>.
He reminds <entidade "Tormund">Tormund</entidade> how the <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade> are feasting and getting fat at <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade>.
<entidade "Styr">Styr</entidade> suggests that <entidade "Tormund">Tormund</entidade> taste crow meat before he dies,as a human arm roasts over a fire.

At the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> 
At <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade>,<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Snow</entidade> has survived the injuries inflicted by <entidade "Ygritte">Ygritte</entidade> and has largely recovered,though he still grimaces while getting dressed and walks with a slight limp.
Having been told of <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>'s death,<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> shares with <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Samwell Tarly</entidade> that he had always been jealous of <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> for having more of their father's affection and for being better than him at riding and fighting,and with girls.
Despite all this,he says he could never bring himself to hate <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>.
<entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> responds by saying he has felt the same way about <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade>,that <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> is better than him at everything ( except reading ).
It turns out that <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> had been sent to retrieve <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade>,who has been summoned to testify before a panel of five sworn brothers,including <entidade "Aemon">Maester Aemon</entidade>,acting <entidade "Alliser Thorne">Lord Commander Alliser Thorne</entidade>,<entidade "First Builder Othell Yarwyck">First Builder Othell Yarwyck</entidade>,and the exiled former <entidade "Lord Commander of the King">Lord Commander of the King</entidade>'s <entidade "Landing City Watch">Landing City Watch</entidade>,<entidade "Janos Slynt">Janos Slynt</entidade>.
Both <entidade "Thorne">Thorne</entidade> and <entidade "Slynt">Slynt</entidade> are openly hostile to <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade>,disbelieving much of what he says.
At the hearing,<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> admits to killing <entidade "Qhorin Halfhand">Qhorin Halfhand</entidade> but says that it was not murder,rather <entidade "Qhorin Halfhand">Qhorin</entidade> wanted <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> to kill him to give <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> credibility with the wildlings in order to get a spy into <entidade "Mance">Mance</entidade>'s army.
<entidade "Slynt">Slynt</entidade> dismisses <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> as the bastard son of a traitor while <entidade "Thorne">Thorne</entidade>,a friend of <entidade "Qhorin Halfhand">Qhorin</entidade>'s,reacts with incredulity that <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> would presume to act like he knew the <entidade "Halfhand">Halfhand</entidade>.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> responds by saying that <entidade "Thorne">Thorne</entidade> should know that <entidade "Qhorin Halfhand">Qhorin</entidade> would have done anything to protect the <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade>.
When <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> refers to the wildlings as Free <entidade "Folk">Folk</entidade>,<entidade "Slynt">Slynt</entidade> accuses him of going native,to the extent he even talks like them.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> snaps back,acknowledging that he talks like a wildling and also admits to living amongst the wildlings,eating with them,and climbing the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> with them.
He catches himself before admitting that he lay with one,but says it anyway.
<entidade "Slynt">Slynt</entidade> calls for <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade>'s execution for breaking one of his vows.
<entidade "Aemon">Aemon</entidade> points out the impracticality of executing every ranger who lays with a girl and says that the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> would be manned by headless men.
<entidade "Thorne">Thorne</entidade> says that there is a difference between sneaking off to a brothel and sleeping with the enemy.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> does not defend himself at this point.
Instead,he says that <entidade "Mance Rayder">Mance Rayder</entidade> intends to attack the <entidade "Night's Watch">Night</entidade>'s Watch with his army of 100,000 wildlings and gives intelligence on <entidade "Mance Rayder">Mance</entidade>'s plan of attack.
Both <entidade "Thorne">Thorne</entidade> and <entidade "Slynt">Slynt</entidade> disbelieve what <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> has to say.
<entidade "Aemon">Aemon</entidade>,however,realizes that <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> is speaking the truth,and the hearing ends with <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> being allowed to keep his head,although after <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> leaves,<entidade "Thorne">Thorne</entidade> expresses his distrust for <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade>.

In the Riverlands 
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya Stark</entidade> and the <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound Sandor Clegane</entidade> are still traveling through the <entidade "Riverlands">Riverlands</entidade> on a single horse.
They pass by overturned carts and dead bodies,including those of children.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> asks when she is going to get her own horse,complaining of the <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound</entidade>'s stench.
He scoffs at the idea,noting that horses are hard to come by and that he wouldn't give <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> her own horse ( even if one was available ) as she is the only thing of value he has since he did not take anything of value when he left <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade>.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> assures him she has no plans to run off,saying that she would die by nightfall without him as she has no one to go to.
The <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound</entidade> reminds her that she still has an aunt in the <entidade "Vale">Vale</entidade>,<entidade "Lysa Arryn">Lysa Arryn</entidade>,to whom he plans to ransom <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade>.
The two eventually come upon a tavern.
Both hungry,<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> suggests that they attack the men there,to which the <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound</entidade> expresses reluctance as there are five men.
Just then,two men exit to relieve themselves.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> recognizes one of them as <entidade "Polliver">Polliver</entidade>,the <entidade "Lannister">Lannister</entidade> man-at-arms who had previously taken <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade>'s sword <entidade "Needle">Needle</entidade> and killed her friend <entidade "Lommy">Lommy</entidade>.
She also notices that <entidade "Polliver">Polliver</entidade> still has <entidade "Needle">Needle</entidade> and runs off to get it back.
The <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound</entidade> chases after her,stopping her at the tavern's door,but they are seen and choose to go in anyways.
It is clear that <entidade "Polliver">Polliver</entidade> and the other men are making trouble and intend to rape the tavern owner's daughter.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> and the <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound</entidade> go to a table far away from everyone else,but <entidade "Polliver">Polliver</entidade> still recognizes the <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound</entidade> and walks over to their table and strikes up a conversation.
He does not recognize <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade>,who he thinks is just the <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound</entidade>'s latest sexual conquest.
<entidade "Polliver">Polliver</entidade> implies that he and his men intend to rape and pillage on their way back to <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade> and invites the <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound</entidade> to come along.
<entidade "Polliver">Polliver</entidade> says that he and his men wear the <entidade "King's Landing">King</entidade>'s colors and can do whatever they like,to which the <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound</entidade> leans forward and states emphatically,<entidade "Fuck">Fuck</entidade> the <entidade "King's Landing">King</entidade>.
The conversation then becomes tense and turns into a standoff.
They eventually draw their swords.
At first,the <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound</entidade> fights the five men alone while <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> stands in the corner.
He easily dispatches two of them and fights off the rest,stabbing one in the groin.
Another,however,gets him on the ground,holding a dagger to his throat.
The <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound</entidade> is able to fight him off,stabbing him repeatedly in the head with his own dagger.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> then joins the fray,smashing a pot over the head of one of the men and stabbing him with his own long sword.
She then slashes <entidade "Polliver">Polliver</entidade>'s leg from behind,causing him to fall to the ground.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> takes Needle from Polliver and stands over his prone form.
She echoes what he had said to <entidade "Lommy">Lommy</entidade> just before he killed him,though <entidade "Polliver">Polliver</entidade> still doesn't recognize her and has no idea what she is talking about.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> then repeats what he had said to her when he took <entidade "Needle">Needle</entidade> : Fine little blade.
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
It is at that point when <entidade "Polliver">Polliver</entidade> recognizes her and becomes frightened.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> then kills <entidade "Polliver">Polliver</entidade> in the same way he had killed <entidade "Lommy">Lommy</entidade> by driving <entidade "Needle">Needle</entidade> slowly into his throat.
<entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> and the <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound</entidade> then leave the tavern,taking with them a horse for <entidade "Arya Stark">Arya</entidade> and a chicken the <entidade "Hound Sandor Clegane">Hound</entidade> wanted.

Across the <entidade "Narrow Sea">Narrow Sea</entidade> 
<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> sits near the sea with her three dragons,each one about the size of a small horse.
<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> strokes <entidade "Drogon">Drogon</entidade>'s head,while <entidade "Rhaegal">Rhaegal</entidade> and <entidade "Viserion">Viserion</entidade> fight over a dead lamb,<entidade "Drogon">Drogon</entidade> joins the fight.
As <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> tries to calm him down,without warning,<entidade "Drogon">Drogon</entidade> snaps at her with a hiss,a warning to not interfere.
He then roars and goes to contest the kill.

<entidade "Drogon">Drogon</entidade> snarls a warning at his mother.
This act,that her own children would threaten her,and that they are outgrowing her influence and ability to rein them,leaves <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> visibly shaken.
<entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah Mormont</entidade> approaches and tells her that dragons can never be tamed,not even by their mother.
<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> returns to her Unsullied army to resume the march to <entidade "Meereen">Meereen</entidade>.
She notices <entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade> and <entidade "Daario Naharis">Daario Naharis</entidade> are absent and sets out to find them after being told they are gambling.
She finds the two men sitting face-to-face holding their swords in front of them ; they have been contesting their strength since midnight.
Daario explains they are deciding on which of them will ride up front with her in the vanguard.
Frustrated,<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> states that the honor goes to <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Ser Jorah</entidade> and <entidade "Barristan">Ser Barristan</entidade> as they did not keep her waiting all morning.
She orders the two men to ride at the back with the livestock.
<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> also adds that the last man holding his sword shall find a new queen to fight for and both men immediately drop their weapons.
On the road to <entidade "Meereen">Meereen</entidade>,<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> speaks with <entidade "Missandei">Missandei</entidade>,who tells her queen that <entidade "Meereen">Meereen</entidade> would be wise to fear her approach.
<entidade "Daario Naharis">Daario</entidade> meets them on the cliff side,and <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> expresses her annoyance when he shows her flowers he has picked.
He reveals that the flowers represent a portrait of the landscape,and serve various purposes,chiefly that knowing her surroundings is important to <entidade "Daenerys'">Daenerys'</entidade> strategy.
The marching army halts,and <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> goes to the forefront,discovering a slave child crucified upon a cross.
The child is dead,her hand pointing the way to <entidade "Meereen">Meereen</entidade>,and <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Ser Jorah</entidade> tells <entidade "Daenerys'">Daenerys</entidade> there is one for each mile to the last of the great slave cities,163 in total.
<entidade "Barristan">Ser Barristan</entidade> offers to have outriders go ahead to bury them,but <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> refuses,ordering that each of them be buried,and their collars removed,but not before she has looked upon each and every face.
