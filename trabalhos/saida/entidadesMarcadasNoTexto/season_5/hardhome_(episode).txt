Summary 
In <entidade " Meereen"> Meereen</entidade> 
In the <entidade " Throne Room"> Throne Room</entidade>,<entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> ponders on what to do with <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade>.
She asks Tyrion why she shouldn't kill him,since the Lannisters are enemies to her <entidade " House"> House</entidade>.
He claims to have killed both of his parents and by that he is an enemy to the <entidade " Lannisters"> Lannisters</entidade> as well.
<entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> isn't convinced that killing one's own familiy is a good reputation for someone in her service.
Tyrion counters by wondering aloud if she at least is worth his service.
Ordered to tell her why he has come to her from the other end of the world,he explains how he learned about her own story from rumours and from <entidade " Varys"> Varys</entidade>.
He says that she a lost girl born in a storm,who with virtually no assistance managed to acquire a barbarian horde,an effective army,conquer three cities,break the slave trade and hatch three dragons might be worth living for when he lost everything he had lived for until then.
He adds that <entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> needs his advice despite having a powerful army and large dragons,as she lacks both political experience and practical knowledge of <entidade " Westeros"> Westeros</entidade>.
She eventually agrees to spare his life,but asks what to do about <entidade " Ser Jorah"> Ser Jorah</entidade>.
She seems poised to fulfil her promise of killing him if she saw him again,as it would not do at all for a queen not to keep her word.
<entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> defends <entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade>,commenting that he is clearly devoted to her and quite possibly in love with her,but also that he did not trust her enough to inform her of his mission to spy on her for <entidade " King Robert"> King Robert</entidade> and that therefore he can not be trusted to stand by her side.
But,he argues,just as a queen should keep true to her oaths,she should also not kill those devoted to her.
<entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> exiles <entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> from the city.
Contemplating his greyscale,<entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> returns to Yezzan zo <entidade " Qaggaz"> Qaggaz</entidade> and offers to fight for him.
He promises to lead <entidade " Yezzan"> Yezzan</entidade>'s team to the <entidade " Great Pit"> Great Pit</entidade> and win the tournament for the <entidade " Queen"> Queen</entidade> after that Yezzan can make a fortune selling <entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> on the black market.
Later,<entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> sit in her solar and have a talk about ambitions.
When <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> mentions what a horrible father <entidade " Tywin"> Tywin</entidade> was,<entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> admits that she no longer has any illusions about her own father.
<entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> is curious about the circumstances of <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade>'s murder of <entidade " Tywin"> Tywin</entidade>.
He wryly promises that if she decides not to kill him then one day he will tell her,but on that day they will need a lot more wine than the large decanter they are drinking from.
They discuss the role of <entidade " Varys"> Varys</entidade> in their stories and <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> assures <entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> he trusts him,and that he's probably the reason she wasn't killed years ago.
Tyrion was convinced by <entidade " Varys"> Varys</entidade> that she could be a ruler who deserves his support.
When <entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> asks how he can get her what she wants,<entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> nearly rolls his eyes at her desire for the <entidade " Iron Throne"> Iron Throne</entidade>.
He suggests that she might want to stay in <entidade " Slaver's Bay"> Slaver's Bay</entidade> and build a new kingdom for herself in <entidade " Meereen"> Meereen</entidade>,complimenting her on reopening the fighting pits and her upcoming political marriage.
She assures him that she will stay and help stabilize things,and make sure the slave trade stays broken,but <entidade " Essos"> Essos</entidade> is not her home.
Tyrion counters that no one will support her in <entidade " Westeros"> Westeros</entidade>,but <entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> somewhat idealistically declares that the common people will support her.
<entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> generously assumes that this will happen ( which it generally doesn't ),but then he reminds <entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> that <entidade " Meereen"> Meereen</entidade> has been in a state of chaos without the combined support of the <entidade " Great Pit"> Great</entidade> <entidade " Masters"> Masters</entidade> and the smallfolk,and extends this to <entidade " Westeros"> Westeros</entidade> and its <entidade " Great Pit"> Great</entidade> <entidade " Houses"> Houses</entidade>.
He notes that <entidade " Houses Targaryen"> Houses Targaryen</entidade> and <entidade " Stark"> Stark</entidade> are effectively dead due to the combined actions of their two terrible fathers.
Neither <entidade " House Lannister"> House Lannister</entidade> nor <entidade " House Baratheon of Dragonstone"> House Baratheon of Dragonstone</entidade> will ever support her claim in light of their histories with the <entidade " Targaryens"> Targaryens</entidade>.
Tyrion says that leaves <entidade " House Tyrell"> House Tyrell</entidade> who might be willing to switch sides due to <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade>'s recent schemes against them but that still isn't enough.
<entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> stubbornly likens the <entidade " Great Houses"> Great Houses</entidade>,including her own <entidade " House Targaryen"> House Targaryen</entidade>,to the spokes on a wheel,one on top and then others,and on and on,crushing the commoners beneath them in their struggle for supremacy.
<entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> sarcastically warns that others have dreamed of stopping the wheel,but <entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> clarifies that she plans to break it.
<entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> decides <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> will remain as her advisor,but confiscates the wine,as a drunk is of no use to her.

In <entidade " Braavos"> Braavos</entidade> 
<entidade " Arya"> Arya</entidade> assumes the identity of <entidade " Lanna"> Lanna</entidade>,a clam-seller,and shows <entidade " Jaqen H'ghar"> Jaqen H'ghar</entidade> she can convincingly become a different person,developing an elaborate and very believable backstory.
The <entidade " Faceless Man"> Faceless Man</entidade> sends her,as <entidade " Lanna"> Lanna</entidade>,to the harbor where she observes someone referred to as the thin man refuse a contract to insure a man's boat,leaving the man in desperate circumstances.
<entidade " Jaqen H'ghar"> Jaqen</entidade> explains the thin man's business is a sort of gamble yet he does not honor his agreements ; when a ship captain dies at sea,he is supposed to make good on his promise and pay the family,but he often doesn't.
<entidade " Jaqen H'ghar"> Jaqen</entidade> instructs her to kill him,and hands her a gift for the thin man a vial of poison.
The waif is skeptical of <entidade " Arya Lanna"> Arya Lanna</entidade>'s success.

In <entidade " King"> King</entidade>'s Landing 
<entidade " Septa Unella"> Septa Unella</entidade> continues to urge an imprisoned <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> to confess in return for her freedom.
She remains defiant,despite being obliged to drink water from the floor out of sheer thirst.
<entidade " Qyburn"> Qyburn</entidade> visits her in her cell,and informs her that her trial will begin soon for the crimes of fornication,treason,incest,and <entidade " Robert"> Robert</entidade>'s murder,all of which <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> furiously dismisses as lies.
<entidade " Qyburn"> Qyburn</entidade> tells her that <entidade " Grand Maester Pycelle"> Grand Maester Pycelle</entidade> has summoned <entidade " Kevan Lannister"> Kevan Lannister</entidade> to serve as <entidade " Hand of the King"> Hand of the King</entidade>.
<entidade " Kevan Lannister"> Kevan</entidade> has,at this point in time,already arrived,and he has refused to visit her in prison.
<entidade " Qyburn"> Qyburn</entidade> also tells her that <entidade " Tommen"> Tommen</entidade> has become reclusive,refusing to see anyone and refusing to eat in his emotional state.
Before leaving,he tells her the work continues on their secret project.

In the <entidade " North"> North</entidade> 
A bitter and determined <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> confronts Reek about his latest betrayal.
<entidade " Reek"> Reek</entidade> apologetically affirms he was helping her and that there is no escaping <entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade>.
He tells her that <entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon Greyjoy</entidade> tried to escape but <entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade> caught him and tortured him until there was no <entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon</entidade> left.
<entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> coldly expresses approval and reminds <entidade " Reek"> Reek</entidade> of the role he played in her family's downfall,and that if she could do to him what <entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade> did,she would.
<entidade " Reek"> Reek</entidade> shamefully admits he deserved his torture as he did terrible things,specifically killing those boys.
Enraged by his dismissive reference seemingly to her brothers as those boys rather than <entidade " Bran"> Bran</entidade> and <entidade " Rickon"> Rickon</entidade>,<entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> vehemently demands to know why they should be dead while he still breathes the air,forcing <entidade " Reek"> Reek</entidade> to finally admit that they were not in fact <entidade " Bran"> Bran</entidade> and <entidade " Rickon"> Rickon</entidade>,only two farm boys.
Stunned by this admission,<entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade>'s anger towards <entidade " Reek"> Reek</entidade> cools but when she presses him as to where they might have gone,calling him <entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon</entidade> again,he breaks down and runs out the room,crying,Not <entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon</entidade> ! 
Reek ! 
<entidade " Roose Bolton"> Roose Bolton</entidade> maintains that his army must wait inside <entidade " Winterfell"> Winterfell</entidade>,thus starving out <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade>' forces,as <entidade " Winterfell"> Winterfell</entidade> had enough supplies to last 6 months under siege.
Such conditions would cause a mutiny in the ranks of the <entidade " Baratheon"> Baratheon</entidade> force and break them down.
<entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade>,on the other hand,has a plan to defeat <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade> decisively and asks his father to lend him just 20 good men.

At the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> 
Gilly continues to tend <entidade " Sam"> Sam</entidade>'s wounds.
Olly enters with some food,having heard what happened.
Once <entidade " Gilly"> Gilly</entidade> leaves,Olly expresses concern at joining forces with the wildlings,particularly <entidade " Tormund"> Tormund</entidade>,who led the raid in which his parents were killed.
<entidade " Sam"> Sam</entidade> reassures  Olly that Jon knows what he is doing,and that unless he is successful,neither the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> nor <entidade " Westeros"> Westeros</entidade> stands a chance against the <entidade " White"> White</entidade> <entidade " Walkers"> Walkers</entidade>.
<entidade " Sam"> Sam</entidade> explains this is a hard choice <entidade " Jon"> Jon</entidade> had to make,however unpopular,and then tells him not to worry,as <entidade " Jon"> Jon</entidade> always comes back.

At <entidade " Hardhome"> Hardhome</entidade> 
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon Snow</entidade> and <entidade " Tormund Giantsbane"> Tormund Giantsbane</entidade>,along with other members of the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> and the <entidade " Free Folk"> Free Folk</entidade>,arrive at the wildling town <entidade " Hardhome"> Hardhome</entidade> to convince the rest of the wildlings to join them in the upcoming war against the <entidade " White"> White</entidade> <entidade " Walkers"> Walkers</entidade> and their armies of Wights.
Insisting on never being an ally with a <entidade " Crow"> Crow</entidade>,The <entidade " Lord of Bones"> Lord of Bones</entidade> insults <entidade " Tormund Giantsbane"> Tormund</entidade> for being at the side of an enemy like <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon Snow</entidade>.
Tormund seizes the <entidade " Lord of Bones"> Lord</entidade>'s staff and beats his former ally to death with it.
The wildling elders decide to gather in the <entidade " Townshall"> Townshall</entidade> to hear out <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade>'s proposal ; an alliance between the <entidade " Free Folk"> Free Folk</entidade> and the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> in the face of their common enemy,the undead.
Having not seen <entidade " Mance Rayder"> Mance Rayder</entidade> since he was taken prisoner at The <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade>,the <entidade " Wildlings"> Wildlings</entidade> question his whereabouts.
<entidade " Snow"> Snow</entidade> reluctantly informs them that he is dead and that he shot him personally with an arrow.
The group is infuriated,but as they move in to kill him,<entidade " Tormund Giantsbane"> Tormund</entidade> vouches for him,describing how <entidade " Rayder"> Rayder</entidade> was about to be burned at the stake as a warning from <entidade " Stannis Baratheon"> Stannis Baratheon</entidade>,and how <entidade " Snow"> Snow</entidade> defied <entidade " Stannis Baratheon"> Stannis</entidade> by ending his life quickly instead of humiliating him and making him suffer in the flames.
Some leaders are convinced,such as <entidade " Karsi"> Karsi</entidade> and the giant <entidade " Wun Wun"> Wun Wun</entidade>,but others like the <entidade " Thenn"> Thenn</entidade> warrior <entidade " Loboda"> Loboda</entidade> begin to leave.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> offers them the dragonglass daggers,telling them that his friend had killed a <entidade " White Walker"> White Walker</entidade> with one.
The <entidade " Wildlings"> Wildlings</entidade> still seem unconvinced.
While approximately five thousand Free <entidade " Folk"> Folk</entidade> gather to set sail to the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade>,the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> starts gathering the dragonglass daggers in the tent.
<entidade " Edd"> Edd</entidade> approaches <entidade " Wun Wun"> Wun Wun</entidade> who holds one of the daggers,examining it curiously.
The giant appears unwilling to hand it over and asks <entidade " Edd"> Edd</entidade> The fuck you looking at ? 
in the giants' rudimentary form of the <entidade " Old Tongue"> Old Tongue</entidade>.
<entidade " Edd"> Edd</entidade> walks away quietly,without collecting the arrowhead.
Suddenly,dogs begin barking and the sounds of a storm are heard.
Recognizing the sign of approaching <entidade " White Walker"> White</entidade> <entidade " Walkers"> Walkers</entidade>,<entidade " Loboda"> Loboda</entidade> orders the gates of <entidade " Hardhome"> Hardhome</entidade> to be shut,abandoning many of the <entidade " Free Folk"> Free Folk</entidade> on the other side to their fate.
As the storm reaches the village,the screams of the people shut outside the walls of <entidade " Hardhome"> Hardhome</entidade> quickly fall silent.
A moment later,a large host of undead wights begin breaking through the gates and climbing over the walls.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade>,<entidade " Tormund Giantsbane"> Tormund</entidade>,<entidade " Loboda"> Loboda</entidade> and <entidade " Karsi"> Karsi</entidade> fight alongside others to give as many people as possible an opportunity to make it to their ships.
<entidade " Eddison Tollett"> Eddison Tollett</entidade>,<entidade " Wun Wun"> Wun Wun</entidade>,and others are trapped inside the townhall,which is set upon by wights and catches fire in the confusion,the bag of dragonglass weapons is lost.

The <entidade " Night King"> Night King</entidade> raises the dead wildlings into wights.
On top of a hill overlooking <entidade " Hardhome"> Hardhome</entidade>,several <entidade " White Walker"> White</entidade> <entidade " Walkers"> Walkers</entidade> mounted on undead horses observe the battle,including the <entidade " Night King"> Night King</entidade>.
Noticing them,and realizing the need for dragonglass,<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> and <entidade " Loboda"> Loboda</entidade> go to the burning townhall,only to be confronted by a <entidade " White Walker"> White Walker</entidade> warrior.
While <entidade " Loboda"> Loboda</entidade> faces the threat,<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon Snow</entidade> goes for the dragonglass.
<entidade " Loboda"> Loboda</entidade> is quickly killed after his axe shatters immediately upon contacting the <entidade " White Walker"> White Walker</entidade>'s ice blade.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> just manages to grab a dragonglass dagger but is tossed aside by the <entidade " White Walker"> White Walker</entidade>.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> retrieves <entidade " Longclaw"> Longclaw</entidade> and defends himself against the <entidade " White Walker"> White Walker</entidade> and both combatants are astonished to see the Valyrian steel remain intact after colliding with the <entidade " White Walker"> White Walker</entidade>'s blade.
Seizing the opportunity,<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> strikes the <entidade " White Walker"> White Walker</entidade>,shattering his body into fragments of ice,confirming that Valyrian steel is just as lethal to them as dragonglass.
The <entidade " Night King"> Night King</entidade>,watching the entire battle from a distance,seems at least mildly intrigued by this turn of events.
Meanwhile,<entidade " Karsi"> Karsi</entidade> fights off multiple wights before being confronted by a pack of undead children.
Frozen by the horror,she is unable to resist as she is mauled to death.
The <entidade " White Walker"> White</entidade> <entidade " Walkers"> Walkers</entidade> deploy another large host of wights,letting them hurl themselves over the cliffs above <entidade " Hardhome"> Hardhome</entidade>.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade>,<entidade " Eddison Tollett"> Edd</entidade>,<entidade " Tormund Giantsbane"> Tormund</entidade> and the remaining defenders flee for their lives.
Shielded by <entidade " Wun Wun"> Wun Wun</entidade>,who throws several wights off himself and wields a burning log as a club before walking into the sea with them,they manage to get to the last remaining boat and quickly row out to a safe distance.
As <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> and the others look on in horror,the <entidade " Night King"> Night King</entidade> raises his arms triumphantly ; all around it,the slain wildlings rise up as undead wights,including <entidade " Karsi"> Karsi</entidade>.
The <entidade " Night King"> Night King</entidade> and his army continue to stare in silence as they retreat.
