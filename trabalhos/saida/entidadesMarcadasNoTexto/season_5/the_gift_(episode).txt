<entidade " Aemon"> Aemon</entidade> happily notes that her son has a laugh just like his little brother <entidade " Egg"> Egg</entidade> ( <entidade " King Aegon V"> King Aegon V</entidade> ) had when he was a baby.
In a moment of clarity,<entidade " Aemon"> Aemon</entidade> gravely warns <entidade " Gilly"> Gilly</entidade> that she and her son must leave the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> while they still can,before winter comes ( and the <entidade " White"> White</entidade> <entidade " Walkers"> Walkers</entidade> with it ).
<entidade " Aemon"> Aemon</entidade>'s condition steadily deteriorates during the night,and he fades in and out of consciousness.
Near the end he wakes up delirious from a dream,still lost in memory from his youth : he calls out to his brother Egg,and says that he had a strange dream that he was an old man.

In the <entidade " North"> North</entidade> 
At <entidade " Winterfell"> Winterfell</entidade>,<entidade " Reek"> Reek</entidade> brings food to <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade>.
She begs him for help,telling him how she has been locked in her bedchamber since her wedding and is visited by <entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade> every night and he forces himself on her.
<entidade " Reek"> Reek</entidade> simply tells her to obey <entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade> or else he would do worse things to her.
<entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> asks what <entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade> did to Reek to break him to such an extent,but he can't bring himself to tell her.
He tries to leave but <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> grabs and reminds him that he betrayed her family,making Reek apologize profusely.
<entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> informs him that her family still has allies in the <entidade " North"> North</entidade> and tells him to light a candle at the top of the <entidade " Broken Tower"> Broken Tower</entidade> which will signal them that she is in danger.
When Reek refuses to do it,<entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> reminds him of his true name,<entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon Greyjoy</entidade>,and makes him promise that he'll help her.
<entidade " Reek"> Reek</entidade> hesitantly agrees.
He trudges through the snow with the candle,up a flight of stairs and into <entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade>'s room.
Later,<entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> is taken to see <entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade> on the ramparts,which are still under construction.
While he is distracted,<entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> grabs a workman's tool lying on a nearby barrel and pockets it.
<entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade> speaks of his thoughts on how they will easily defeat <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade>'s army since their soldiers,unlike <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade>'s,are trained to fight in the snow,and how he'll one day be the <entidade " Lord of Winterfell"> Lord of Winterfell</entidade> and the <entidade " Warden of the North"> Warden of the North</entidade>.
<entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> reminds him of the unborn baby,who,if a boy,will have a stronger claim on the <entidade " North"> North</entidade> since he'll be a true-born.
<entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade> tells her that he is <entidade " Roose Bolton"> Roose Bolton</entidade>'s eldest son,legitimized by the king,who <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> reminds him is another bastard.
<entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade> is obviously angered by <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade>'s remarks,but doesn't act on it,simply stating that bastards can rise in the world too,informing her of <entidade " Jon"> Jon</entidade>'s appointment as <entidade " Lord Commander of the Night"> Lord Commander of the Night</entidade>'s <entidade " Watch"> Watch</entidade>.
<entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade> then brings up the reason why he summoned her,and shows her the crucified and partly flayed corpse of the old woman who promised to help Sansa if she lit a candle in the <entidade " Broken Tower"> Broken Tower</entidade>.
<entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade> then reveals to Sansa that <entidade " Reek"> Reek</entidade>,who seems miserable to have squashed <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade>'s only hope of an escape,came to him and told him everything.
<entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> chokes back tears as a gleeful <entidade " Ramsay"> Ramsay</entidade> orders his men to take her back to her chamber.
Meanwhile,<entidade " Brienne"> Brienne</entidade> stares intently at <entidade " Winterfell"> Winterfell</entidade> castle from her room in the inn,waiting for the sign to rescue <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade>.
<entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade>'s troops make camp during a violent snowstorm.
<entidade " Davos Seaworth"> Davos Seaworth</entidade> meets with <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade> and informs him that forty horses died the previous night and more will die come sunset.
The <entidade " Stormcrows"> Stormcrows</entidade>,a sellsword company,have fled in the night.
<entidade " Davos Seaworth"> Davos</entidade> thinks that they should go back to <entidade " Castle Black"> Castle Black</entidade> and wait out the weather since they do not have enough food,but <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade> stubbornly tells him that they will not retreat to <entidade " Castle Black"> Castle Black</entidade> because he will not risk being known as the <entidade " King"> King</entidade> who <entidade " Ran"> Ran</entidade>.
As winter will soon arrive,they also run the risk of being stuck at <entidade " Castle Black"> Castle Black</entidade> for years,during which the <entidade " Boltons"> Boltons</entidade> will regain their strength.
Seeing no other way to convince <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade> otherwise,<entidade " Davos Seaworth"> Davos</entidade> leaves.
<entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade> asks <entidade " Melisandre"> Melisandre</entidade> if she is sure of their victory at <entidade " Winterfell"> Winterfell</entidade>.
<entidade " Melisandre"> Melisandre</entidade> assures him,reminding him that he also saw the vision of his victory in the flames,but <entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade> is not so sure what he saw anymore.
<entidade " Melisandre"> Melisandre</entidade> reassures him that her visions will come true,but also states that a sacrifice,one with <entidade " King"> King</entidade>'s blood,must be made in order to ensure their victory,implying that they sacrifice <entidade " Shireen"> Shireen</entidade>.
<entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade> is infuriated by the suggestion and orders her to leave.

In <entidade " Dorne"> Dorne</entidade> 
Prince <entidade " Doran"> Doran</entidade> has <entidade " Areo Hotah"> Areo Hotah</entidade> bring <entidade " Myrcella"> Myrcella</entidade> to <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> in the quarters where he is confined,as <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> is concerned for her safety.
Displaying a somewhat more critical mind than her brothers,<entidade " Myrcella"> Myrcella</entidade> is suspicious about <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade>'s diplomatic mission to bring her back to <entidade " King's Landing"> King's Landing</entidade>,to which <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> only replies that there are complicated matters involved.
<entidade " Myrcella"> Myrcella</entidade> flatly refuses to return with him,stating her intent to marry <entidade " Trystane"> Trystane</entidade>.
<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> is singing The <entidade " Dornishman's Wife"> Dornishman's Wife</entidade> in his jail cell,while in the adjoining cell,the <entidade " Sand Snakes"> Sand Snakes</entidade> listen with a mix of annoyance from <entidade " Obara"> Obara</entidade> and <entidade " Nymeria"> Nymeria</entidade> and amusement from <entidade " Tyene"> Tyene</entidade>.
After he finishes,the two parties trade barbs,and <entidade " Tyene"> Tyene</entidade> inquires about <entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade>'s arm,which she cut with her daggers during their earlier fight,with <entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> brushing it off as a new scar.
The two begin to talk about <entidade " Tyene"> Tyene</entidade>'s beauty,which <entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> dismisses until she begins to disrobe.
<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> stares intently,and begins to change his mind about her.
<entidade " Tyene"> Tyene</entidade> once again inquires about his arm,and then his head,at which point <entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade>'s nose starts bleeding and his vision blurs.
<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> collapses and tries to play off his sudden illness,but <entidade " Tyene"> Tyene</entidade> reveals that her daggers were coated with a slow-acting poison called The <entidade " Long Farewell"> Long Farewell</entidade>,and her attempts to seduce <entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> were to get his heart pumping faster,thereby allowing the poison to act quicker.
She points to an ampoule on her necklace,which contains the antidote,but only offers to give it to <entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> on the condition that he agrees that she is the most beautiful woman in the world.
Growing weaker,<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> barely manages to reply affirmatively,and she tosses the ampoule to a relieved <entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade>.
<entidade " Tyene"> Tyene</entidade> smiles smugly at him and remarks that she finds him handsome as well,before re-robing and sitting down next to her mildly amused half-sisters.

In <entidade " King's Landing"> King</entidade>'s Landing 
In the <entidade " Great Sept of Baelor"> Great Sept of Baelor</entidade>,<entidade " Lady Olenna"> Lady Olenna</entidade> meets with the <entidade " High Sparrow"> High Sparrow</entidade> to discuss the imprisonment of her grandchildren,<entidade " Ser Loras"> Ser Loras</entidade> and <entidade " Queen Margaery"> Queen Margaery</entidade>.
Although they briefly bond over the infirmities of age,she demands that he release them and he declines,stating they will be punished for their crimes.
The <entidade " High Sparrow"> High Sparrow</entidade> tells her that the <entidade " Gods' Laws"> Gods' Laws</entidade> must be applied to everyone equally.
<entidade " Olenna"> Olenna</entidade> first tries to bribe him,but learning that he can not be bought,threatens to end the <entidade " Tyrell"> Tyrell</entidade> support for the capital by ending shipments of food.
Again the <entidade " High Sparrow"> High Sparrow</entidade> is unfazed,remarking that the nobility of <entidade " Westeros"> Westeros</entidade> have forgotten they are outnumbered by the common folk and tells <entidade " Olenna"> Olenna</entidade> to ponder what happens when the many stop fearing the few.
Returning to her palanquin,<entidade " Olenna"> Olenna</entidade> receives a letter bearing <entidade " Petyr Baelish"> Petyr Baelish</entidade>'s seal.
Meanwhile,in the <entidade " Red Keep"> Red Keep</entidade>,<entidade " King Tommen"> King Tommen</entidade> rails over his inability to help <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade>.
He wants to start a war for <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade>,declaring his love for her to a dumbstruck <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade>.
To maintain control of the situation,she offers to speak with the <entidade " High Sparrow"> High Sparrow</entidade> for him and advocate for <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> and <entidade " Loras"> Loras</entidade>'s release.
Although clearly suspicious,the still-overwhelmed <entidade " Tommen"> Tommen</entidade> agrees.
<entidade " Littlefinger"> Littlefinger</entidade> meets with <entidade " Olenna"> Olenna</entidade> in his ransacked brothel,where they share a tense conversation.
<entidade " Olenna"> Olenna</entidade> reminds him of the role they both played in <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade>'s murder,and that,should her <entidade " House"> House</entidade> fall,she will have no reason to keep his involvement a secret.
<entidade " Littlefinger"> Littlefinger</entidade> explains why he returned to <entidade " King's Landing"> King's Landing</entidade> - he dared not refuse <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade>'s summons,and was obliged to give her information.
He tells Olenna that he will give her the same thing he gave <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> : a handsome young man implied,in this instance,to be <entidade " Lancel"> Lancel</entidade>.
In the <entidade " Sept"> Sept</entidade>'s cells,<entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> meets with <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> and brings her food but <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> refuses,revealing that she knows her mother-in-law is responsible for having her and <entidade " Loras"> Loras</entidade> imprisoned.
<entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade>,fearful of being overheard,denies this.
Margaery mocks <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> for her unconvincing lies of trying to save her,going as far as to say that while she knows how to lie and scheme,she doesn't understand innocence and decency,which <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> suspects is why <entidade " Tommen"> Tommen</entidade> loves her,<entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade>,and was willing to send <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> back to <entidade " Casterly Rock"> Casterly Rock</entidade>.
<entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade>,concealing her fury,tells <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> her trial will soon begin and that her son needs his mother more than ever.
Margaery throws the stew at <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade>,and yells at her to get out.
<entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> leaves the cell,smiling smugly at <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade>.
On her way out,a still gleeful <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> meets with the <entidade " High Sparrow"> High Sparrow</entidade> in a chapel that predates the <entidade " Great Sept of Baelor"> Great Sept</entidade>.
The pair briefly discuss the legal process that <entidade " Margaery"> Margaery</entidade> and <entidade " Loras"> Loras</entidade> will face.
As the conversation goes on,however,it's clear that the <entidade " High Sparrow"> High Sparrow</entidade> is about to turn the tables on <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade>.
When <entidade " Brother Lancel"> Brother Lancel</entidade> appears,<entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> realizes what is about to happen,and her triumphant smile begins to crack.

<entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> is sold by <entidade " Malko"> Malko</entidade> to <entidade " Yezzan zo Qaggaz"> Yezzan zo Qaggaz</entidade>.
Before <entidade " Yezzan zo Qaggaz"> Yezzan</entidade> leaves,<entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> convinces him that <entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> and he are a team,and is also bought.

<entidade " Dany"> Dany</entidade> is reluctant to do so,as she believes it will give her the reputation of a butcher,to which <entidade " Daario"> Daario</entidade> replies that all rulers are either butchers or meat.
<entidade " Yezzan zo Qaggaz"> Yezzan</entidade> takes his fighters to <entidade " Meereen"> Meereen</entidade>,to test them in the lower pits and seek out those who are worthy to fight in the <entidade " Great Pit of Daznak"> Great Pit of Daznak</entidade>.
They fight in front of a reluctant <entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade>,as <entidade " Hizdahr zo Loraq"> Hizdahr</entidade> has convinced her that <entidade " Meereen"> Meereen</entidade>'s ruler occasionally makes the rounds to the lower pits ahead of the main tournament.
<entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> enters the <entidade " Pits"> Pits</entidade> early,upon realizing that she is watching and will be repulsed by what she's seeing,and elbows down <entidade " Yezzan zo Qaggaz"> Yezzan</entidade> who tried to berate him.
<entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> easily defeats the other fighters without killing them,impressing <entidade " Dany"> Dany</entidade> enough to prevent her from leaving.
When he reveals his identity,however,her face swiftly twists into a scowl and she orders him taken away.
Before the <entidade " Unsullied"> Unsullied</entidade> can comply,<entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> declares that he brought her a gift,and <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> enters the arena and reveals his identity to the astonished <entidade " Queen"> Queen</entidade>.
