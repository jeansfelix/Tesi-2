<entidade "Kill">Kill</entidade> the <entidade "Boy">Boy</entidade> 

Sons of the <entidade "Harpy">Harpy</entidade> is the fourth episode of the fifth season of <entidade "Game of Thrones">Game of Thrones</entidade>.
It is the forty-fourth episode of the series overall.
It premiered on <entidade "May 3, 2015">May 3, 2015</entidade>.
It was written by <entidade "Dave Hill">Dave Hill</entidade>,and directed by <entidade "Mark Mylod">Mark Mylod</entidade>.

Plot 
The <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith Militant</entidade> grow increasingly aggressive ; <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> and <entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> head south ; <entidade "Ellaria">Ellaria</entidade> and the <entidade "Sand Snakes">Sand Snakes</entidade> vow vengeance.

In <entidade "King">King</entidade>'s Landing 
At a <entidade "Small Council">Small Council</entidade> meeting,<entidade "Master of Coin Mace Tyrell">Master of Coin Mace Tyrell</entidade> brings bad news that the <entidade "Iron Bank of Braavos">Iron Bank of Braavos</entidade> is starting to call in its debts from <entidade "Westeros">Westeros</entidade>.
They have started by calling in a tenth of the <entidade "Iron Throne">Iron Throne</entidade>'s current debts to the bank,which it can only afford half of as rebuilding the <entidade "Royal Fleet">Royal Fleet</entidade> was also a massive expense.
Mace offers that <entidade "House Tyrell">House Tyrell</entidade> could front the money for the time being,but <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> clearly does not want to give the <entidade "Tyrells">Tyrells</entidade> more power over the crown.
Instead,she says that they will send <entidade "Mace">Mace</entidade> himself to <entidade "Braavos">Braavos</entidade> to negotiate for more time,because sending such a high-ranking official will show the bank how seriously they take their large debts.
Mace is oblivious that this is also <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade>'s way of removing him from the capital,and takes it as a high honor - as well as that <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> will send <entidade "Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard">Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard</entidade> along to guard him.
After he leaves,<entidade "Pycelle">Pycelle</entidade> bitterly points out that the <entidade "Small Council">Small Council</entidade> is growing even smaller ( the only three members left in the capital are <entidade "Pycelle">Pycelle</entidade>,<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade>,and her lackey <entidade "Qyburn">Qyburn</entidade> ),but she says it hasn't quite grown small enough yet.

<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> meets with the <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade>.
<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> then meets with the <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade>,who by her influence,has been elected as the new <entidade "High Septon of the Faith of the Seven">High Septon of the Faith of the Seven</entidade>.
<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> is trying to build up a new alliance between the <entidade "Crown">Crown</entidade> and the <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith</entidade>,as a counterweight against the large political influence the <entidade "Tyrells">Tyrells</entidade> now possess.
<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> points out to the High Sparrow that the War of the Five Kings has devastated much of the countryside,resulting in septs being burned,clergymen attacked,and even <entidade "Silent Sisters">Silent Sisters</entidade> raped.
Bodies of holy men are piling up in the streets.
The <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade> admits that wars make men obey the sword more than the gods.
<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> points out that before the <entidade "Targaryens">Targaryens</entidade>,the military order known as the <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith Militant</entidade> dispensed the justice of the <entidade "Seven">Seven</entidade>.
The <entidade "High Septon of the Faith of the Seven">High Septon</entidade> is confused,as the <entidade "Targaryens">Targaryens</entidade> disbanded the <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith Militant</entidade> over two centuries ago.
<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> explains that,as part of the new alliance she hopes to build between the <entidade "Crown">Crown</entidade> and the <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith</entidade>,she will tell her son to repeal the law and allow the <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith Militant</entidade> to be reestablished and re-armed : an army whose purpose is to defend the <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith</entidade>,holy men,and the smallfolk - and which will incidentally be turned against the <entidade "Crown">Crown</entidade>'s enemies.
She then advises him that there is a great sinner in their midst who has been shielded by gold and power.
The <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade> replies with a wish for The <entidade "Father">Father</entidade> to judge him justly.
The new <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith Militant</entidade> storm the streets of <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade>,attacking taverns,brothels,and street vendors selling idols from other religions.
The <entidade "City Watch">City Watch</entidade> look on,helpless,and do not intervene.
They ransack <entidade "Littlefinger">Littlefinger</entidade>'s brothel,dragging prostitutes like <entidade "Marei">Marei</entidade> out into the street by their hair.
<entidade "Olyvar">Olyvar</entidade> is struck and ignored as they barge in ; he then sees that in another room they have singled out a man having sex with one of the male prostitutes,and approach him with a knife.
<entidade "Olyvar">Olyvar</entidade> flees.

Tommen attempts to have his brother-in-law <entidade "Loras">Loras</entidade> released,but fails.
As a sign of their zealotry,the <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith Militant</entidade> have the Seven-Pointed <entidade "Star">Star</entidade> symbol of the <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith</entidade> carved into their foreheads - including <entidade "Lancel">Lancel</entidade>,who leads a squad of the <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith Militant</entidade> to apprehend <entidade "Loras Tyrell">Loras Tyrell</entidade> while he is sparring in the practice yard.
<entidade "Lancel">Lancel</entidade> proclaims that <entidade "Loras Tyrell">Loras</entidade>' sexual perversions are sins against the laws of gods and men,and <entidade "Loras Tyrell">Loras</entidade> is dragged off.
<entidade "Margaery Tyrell">Margaery Tyrell</entidade> is furious at <entidade "Tommen">Tommen</entidade> for her brother's arrest,then tries to manipulate him by weeping at how hurt she is that he let this happen to <entidade "Loras Tyrell">Loras</entidade>.
Tommen then goes to his mother and,briefly standing up to her,demands that <entidade "Loras Tyrell">Loras</entidade> be released at once.
<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> calmly points out that she didn't arrest <entidade "Loras Tyrell">Loras</entidade>,the <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith Militant</entidade> simply dragged him off and imprisoned him,so he should ask the <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade> to release him.
Tommen naively thinks the <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade> will simply do as he requests,so he heads to the <entidade "Great Sept of Baelor">Great Sept of Baelor</entidade> with five <entidade "Kingsguard">Kingsguard</entidade> and several <entidade "Lannister">Lannister</entidade> guards.
The path to the <entidade "Great Sept of Baelor">Great Sept</entidade> is blocked by the <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith Militant</entidade>,who say that the <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade> is praying and does not wish to be disturbed.
The <entidade "Kingsguard">Kingsguard</entidade> request that <entidade "Tommen">Tommen</entidade> let them kill the <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith Militant</entidade> to pass.
Tommen is surprised at this and does not want to risk bloodshed escalating matters - particularly,shedding blood on holy ground.
Unsure of what to do,the mob of commoners behind him starts shouting that he is really a bastard and an abomination of incest.
Realizing this is not going to end well,<entidade "Tommen">Tommen</entidade> meekly withdraws back to the <entidade "Red Keep">Red Keep</entidade>.
Margaery is even more upset at how ineffectual young <entidade "Tommen">Tommen</entidade> was,so she leaves saying that she is going to bring her grandmother <entidade "Olenna">Olenna</entidade> back to the capital to deal with this.

In <entidade "Dorne">Dorne</entidade> 
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</entidade> and <entidade "Bronn">Ser Bronn</entidade> are on a <entidade "Pentoshi">Pentoshi</entidade> merchant ship,which is headed to Oldtown in the Reach.
They sail past <entidade "Tarth">Tarth</entidade>,off the coast of the <entidade "Stormlands">Stormlands</entidade>,which <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> mistakenly identifies as <entidade "Estermont">Estermont</entidade>.
The captain corrects him,stating that they are sailing through the <entidade "Sapphire Isle">Sapphire Isle</entidade>,which reminds him of <entidade "Brienne">Brienne</entidade>.
Jaime explains to Bronn that he bribed the captain to let them take a small boat to shore as they pass <entidade "Dorne">Dorne</entidade>,and they will land just outside of <entidade "Sunspear">Sunspear</entidade> and the adjacent <entidade "Water">Water</entidade> <entidade "Gardens">Gardens</entidade>.
Below decks,<entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> remarks on why <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> must want to go and protect <entidade "Myrcella">Princess Myrcella</entidade> for himself : he's the one who let <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> escape,and he hopes this will make up for that.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> curtly says that <entidade "Varys">Varys</entidade> did ( when in fact,<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> forced <entidade "Varys">Varys</entidade> to help him free Tyrion ).
<entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> says that if <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> ever sees <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> again <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> should give him his regards ; <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> angrily says that if he sees his brother again,he's going to split him in two for murdering their father <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade>.

Jaime uses his metal hand to stop a blade.
<entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> rows the pair ashore at dusk,though <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> can't help row with his one hand.
When they awake the next morning <entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> kills a snake that was near <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade>'s head and roasts it up for breakfast.
<entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> is worried that the ship's captain will subsequently spread word that a <entidade "Lannister">Lannister</entidade> is in <entidade "Dorne">Dorne</entidade> ; <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> says he bribed him with a large bag of gold,but <entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> still worries.
A mounted patrol soon comes by,however,and sees their tracks in the sand.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> and <entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> present themselves and try to pass off that they are simple travelers and their boat capsized in the night,but the ruse doesn't work,and the sentries demand that they drop their weapons so they can be taken prisoner and their identities confirmed.
Bronn plants his sword in the sand - then quickly throws his dagger in the lead sentry's throat.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> and <entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> draw their swords and fight the rest.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> can't fight very well left-handed so <entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> kills one sentry's horse in order for <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> to fight him on foot.
Jaime is being overpowered but catches the sentry's sword with his metal hand at the last moment.
He then uses the distraction to land a killing blow to the sentry with his left hand.
<entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade>,having finished off the other sentries,notes that they now have their horses : fine <entidade "Dornish">Dornish</entidade> sand steeds,capable of running a day and a night without tiring.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> says the bodies need to be buried so they won't raise more questions.
<entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> says it will take a lot of time to dig holes for them all,though <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> again points out that he can't really do much digging with one hand.
<entidade "Annoyed">Annoyed</entidade>,<entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> then drags off the bodies to bury.

The <entidade "Sand Snakes">Sand Snakes</entidade> torture a merchant ship captain.
Meanwhile,elsewhere outside of <entidade "Sunspear">Sunspear</entidade>,<entidade "Ellaria Sand">Ellaria Sand</entidade> meets with three of the eight <entidade "Sand Snakes">Sand Snakes</entidade>,her lover <entidade "Oberyn Martell">Oberyn Martell</entidade>'s bastard daughters.
<entidade "Obara Sand">Obara Sand</entidade>,the eldest,is the daughter of a peasant ; <entidade "Nymeria Sand">Nymeria Sand</entidade> ( commonly called <entidade "Nymeria Sand">Nym</entidade> ) is the daughter of an eastern noblewoman ; the youngest of the three,<entidade "Tyene Sand">Tyene Sand</entidade>,is <entidade "Ellaria Sand">Ellaria</entidade>'s own daughter.
She informs them that <entidade "Doran Martell">Prince Doran Martell</entidade> will not raise <entidade "Dorne">Dorne</entidade>'s armies to avenge his brother's death.
They worry that they have no army to march against the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade>,but <entidade "Ellaria Sand">Ellaria</entidade> tells them that they don't need one : to start a war,all they need to do is kill <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade>'s daughter <entidade "Myrcella">Myrcella</entidade>,currently in <entidade "Doran Martell">Doran</entidade>'s possession.
<entidade "Obara Sand">Obara</entidade> then points out that they may have a problem.
The <entidade "Pentoshi">Pentoshi</entidade> ship captain found her in <entidade "Planky Town">Planky Town</entidade>,and as <entidade "Bronn">Bronn</entidade> feared,he indeed tried to sell her information about <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</entidade>'s arrival in <entidade "Dorne">Dorne</entidade>.
The <entidade "Sand Snakes">Sand Snakes</entidade>,however,were insulted that he wanted to be paid for such vital information instead of offering it freely,so they took him prisoner and tortured it out of him.
<entidade "Nymeria Sand">Nymeria</entidade> uses her whip to knock a bucket over,and reveals underneath that they buried the ship's captain neck-deep in the sand,with his head under a bucket full of poisonous scorpions.
They realize that they are now in a race against time to see who can take Myrcella from <entidade "Doran Martell">Doran</entidade> first : <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</entidade> or themselves.
<entidade "Ellaria Sand">Ellaria</entidade> asks if the three girls are with her,knowing this will bring <entidade "Dorne">Dorne</entidade> into war.
<entidade "Nymeria Sand">Nymeria</entidade> and <entidade "Tyene Sand">Tyene</entidade> say yes.
<entidade "Obara Sand">Obara</entidade> notes that when she first met <entidade "Oberyn Martell">Oberyn</entidade>,he was a man whom she had never met who one day appeared,said he was her father,and that he was taking her away from her mother.
Her mother wept,but <entidade "Oberyn Martell">Oberyn</entidade> said that,we all must choose our battles and the gods let us choose our weapons.
He threw his spear at her feet,pointed to her mother's tears,then to his spear,and told her to choose.
She chose the spear - and answers Ellaria that she is with her,as she chose the path of the spear and war long ago.
She then throws her spear to impale the ship captain's head.

In the Free Cities 
Tyrion is held captive by <entidade "Jorah">Jorah</entidade>.
At <entidade "Volantis">Volantis</entidade>,during the night,<entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah Mormont</entidade> knocks out a fisherman and steals his boat,leaving with his captive <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</entidade>.
Later when they are at sea,<entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> urges for <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> to remove his gag.
<entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> will not volunteer any information about himself,but from a few observations ( such as the bear sigil on his armor ),<entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> quickly surmises that he must be <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah Mormont</entidade>.
He admits to Tyrion that the <entidade "Queen">Queen</entidade> he is taking him to is not <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> but <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade>.
Tyrion recalls from <entidade "Small Council">Small Council</entidade> meetings that <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> was spying on Daenerys for Varys.
Given that he is half the world away from <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade>,he also accurately deduces that she must have found out he was spying on her and had him exiled - and therefore,he kidnapped <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> in the hope that presenting him as a gift to <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> will get him back in her favor.
<entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> laughs aloud at his situation,informing <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> that he was already heading to meet <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade>,so this is a waste of a kidnapping.
Tyrion also points out that there is no guarantee this will assuage <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade>,and it is just as likely she will remain angry at <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade>,and welcome himself as an ally.
<entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> smacks <entidade "Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion</entidade> across the face,quieting him down.

At the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> 
<entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> seduces <entidade "Jon">Jon</entidade>.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Snow</entidade> trains recruits in the practice yard of <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade>,as <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</entidade> and his wife <entidade "Selyse">Selyse</entidade> watch,along with their daughter <entidade "Shireen">Shireen</entidade>.
<entidade "Selyse">Selyse</entidade> is worried that <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> wishes <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> was his son,because she gave him only stillbirths and weakness,but he says that wasn't her fault.
<entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> joins them and appears to quite firmly take <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade>'s side,declaring that the <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade> doesn't care about <entidade "Shireen's Greyscale">Shireen's Greyscale</entidade> disfigurement,and this doesn't change the fact that she has her father's blood.
When <entidade "Selyse">Selyse</entidade> departs,<entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> discusses the coming battle to take Winterfell from the Boltons.
She asks if <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> intends to leave her behind as he did at the <entidade "Blackwater">Blackwater</entidade>,but <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> assures her he won't this time.
As the new <entidade "Commander">Lord Commander</entidade>,<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> goes over paperwork with <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Samwell Tarly</entidade>,letters they have received from minor Houses offering up a handful of new recruits.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> balks when <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Samwell</entidade> hands him a request letter for <entidade "Roose Bolton">Roose Bolton</entidade>,saying he killed his brother <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>.
<entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> points out that <entidade "Roose Bolton">Roose Bolton</entidade> is now the <entidade "Warden of the North">Warden of the North</entidade>,and he has the most recruits to send them - much more than the pittances offered by the other minor <entidade "Houses Jon">Houses Jon</entidade> has never even heard of.
He reminds Jon that the Night's <entidade "Watch">Watch</entidade> has sworn an oath of political neutrality.
With disgust,<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> reluctantly signs the letter to the <entidade "Boltons">Boltons</entidade>.
As <entidade "Samwell Tarly">Sam</entidade> departs,<entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> enters.
She entreats him to assist <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> in retaking <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade>,pointing out that even if he doesn't become a <entidade "Stark">Stark</entidade>,his familiarity with the castle could win them the battle.
She also acknowledges that there is a greater war at stake,and asks <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> if he is on the side of life or death,undoing her dress and straddling him as she does so.
She encourages <entidade "Snow">Snow</entidade> to take her,as the <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade> made humans male and female for a reason ; although clearly tempted,<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> refuses,citing his vows,and the fact that <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> wouldn't approve ( to which <entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> suggests they not tell him ).
When <entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> points out that he broke his vows once before,<entidade "Snow">Snow</entidade> acknowledges that he still feels for his deceased love.
<entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> adjusts her dress and leaves,but not before uttering the words the new <entidade "Commander">Lord Commander</entidade> thought he'd never hear again : You know nothing,<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Snow</entidade>.
Later,<entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> is in his chambers at <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade> working on other letters,and <entidade "Shireen's Greyscale">Shireen</entidade> enters.
Stannis begins to apologise for dragging her along on campaign with him,as <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade> is hardly a place for a child,but <entidade "Shireen's Greyscale">Shireen</entidade> cuts him off ; she is happy to have come,having expected to be left at <entidade "Dragonstone">Dragonstone</entidade>,as <entidade "Selyse">Selyse</entidade> had made it clear she wanted.
Shireen asks her father if he is ashamed of her because of her deformity ; <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> gets up from his table and explains that not long after <entidade "Shireen's Greyscale">Shireen</entidade> was born,a Dornish trader arrived on <entidade "Dragonstone">Dragonstone</entidade> and,having heard of <entidade "Shireen's Greyscale">Shireen</entidade>'s birth,gave a wooden doll as a gift for the newborn girl.
Unfortunately,the doll was contaminated with greyscale,and by the time that was discovered,<entidade "Shireen's Greyscale">Shireen</entidade> had already contracted the disease.
Everyone claimed <entidade "Shireen's Greyscale">Shireen</entidade> would die of it sooner or later,and urged <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> to send her to the ruins of <entidade "Valyria">Valyria</entidade> to live out her days with the <entidade "Stone Men">Stone Men</entidade> before the disease infected the rest of the castle ; <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> says he told them all to go to hell and summoned every healer,apothecary and <entidade "Maester">Maester</entidade> he could to save <entidade "Shireen's Greyscale">Shireen</entidade>.
<entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> insists that <entidade "Shireen's Greyscale">Shireen</entidade> is his daughter and he would not send her away because she belonged with her family.
<entidade "Shireen's Greyscale">Shireen</entidade>,overjoyed at her father's declaration,runs over and gives him a hug which,after an awkward pause,<entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> returns.

In the <entidade "North">North</entidade> 
<entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> visits the tombs of her family.
At <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade>,<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa Stark</entidade> takes the opportunity to visit her family's underground crypts.
She comes to the tomb and statue of her aunt <entidade "Lyanna Stark">Lyanna Stark</entidade> ( and finds the feather token that <entidade "Robert Baratheon">Robert Baratheon</entidade> left there years ago when he visited the castle ).
<entidade "Petyr Baelish">Petyr Baelish</entidade> arrives and says he thought he'd find her there.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> remarks that her father,<entidade "Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</entidade>,never talked about <entidade "Lyanna Stark">Lyanna</entidade>,but she would at times find him down in the crypts lighting candles at her tomb.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> never knew <entidade "Lyanna Stark">Lyanna</entidade> because she died before she was born,but she notes that people say she was beautiful.
<entidade "Littlefinger">Littlefinger</entidade> says that he actually saw <entidade "Lyanna Stark">Lyanna</entidade> once years ago,and she was as beautiful as everyone says.
Back when he was a boy living with <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade>'s mother's family,the old <entidade "Lord Whent of Harrenhal">Lord Whent of Harrenhal</entidade> held a massive tournament : every notable figure of the time came from across Westeros : the <entidade "Mad King">Mad King</entidade>,<entidade "Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen">Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen</entidade>,<entidade "Robert Baratheon">Robert Baratheon</entidade>,<entidade "Lyanna Stark">Lyanna Stark</entidade>,everyone.
<entidade "Lyanna Stark">Lyanna</entidade> had already been publicly betrothed to <entidade "Robert Baratheon">Robert</entidade> at the time.
Baelish remembers how awed he was,a boy from nowhere and with no significant holdings,to see all of these living legends gathered in one place.
In the final tilt,<entidade "Rhaegar">Prince Rhaegar</entidade> rode against <entidade "Barristan Selmy">Ser Barristan Selmy</entidade>.
<entidade "Rhaegar">Rhaegar</entidade> won and the entire crowd erupted in cheers - only to suddenly drop dead silent when <entidade "Rhaegar">Rhaegar</entidade> rode right past his wife,<entidade "Elia Martell">Elia Martell</entidade>,to lay the victor's crown ( made of blue winter roses ) in <entidade "Lyanna Stark">Lyanna</entidade>'s lap.
Not long afterwards,<entidade "Rhaegar">Rhaegar</entidade> made off with <entidade "Lyanna Stark">Lyanna</entidade>,sparking off <entidade "Robert's Rebellion">Robert's Rebellion</entidade> which overthrew the <entidade "Targaryen">Targaryen</entidade> dynasty.
Littlefinger wonders how many thousands died because <entidade "Rhaegar">Rhaegar</entidade> chose <entidade "Lyanna Stark">Lyanna</entidade> - to which <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> says that he chose her,then kidnapped and raped her.
Baelish gives her a wry look and moves on to another part of the crypts.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> notices that <entidade "Littlefinger">Littlefinger</entidade> is wearing riding clothes,and he explains that he is heading back to <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade>,because <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> sent a letter requesting his presence and it would be best not to make her suspicious by refusing to come.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> will be alone with the Boltons but he explains his plan to her : Stannis will have to attack the <entidade "Boltons">Boltons</entidade> soon if he is to beat the winter snows,and he bets that <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> will probably win,because he is one of the best military commanders in all of <entidade "Westeros">Westeros</entidade>,and the <entidade "Boltons">Boltons</entidade> will be outnumbered by <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade>,as the other northern houses would be quick to betray their liege lord.
<entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> will then make <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> the new ruler of the <entidade "North">North</entidade>,as the last ( known ) surviving <entidade "Stark">Stark</entidade> heir and in memory of her father <entidade "Eddard Stark">Eddard</entidade>'s support for <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade>.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> asks what will happen on the off chance that <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> gets killed,and <entidade "Littlefinger">Littlefinger</entidade> explains that marrying <entidade "Ramsay Bolton">Ramsay Bolton</entidade> now will at least leave <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> in a position to insinuate herself among the <entidade "Boltons">Boltons</entidade> and help destroy them from within in future plans.
Either way,<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> will be <entidade "Littlefinger">Littlefinger</entidade>'s powerful ally in the <entidade "North">North</entidade>.
<entidade "Littlefinger">Littlefinger</entidade> kisses <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> on the lips,and departs.

In <entidade "Meereen">Meereen</entidade> 
<entidade "Dany">Dany</entidade> speaks with <entidade "Barristan Selmy">Ser Barristan</entidade>.
In <entidade "Meereen">Meereen</entidade>,<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> is looking down on the streets below from her royal apartments in the <entidade "Great Pyramid">Great Pyramid</entidade>,and <entidade "Barristan Selmy">Ser Barristan Selmy</entidade> also brings up <entidade "Rhaegar Targaryen">Rhaegar Targaryen</entidade>.
He says that the city's inhabitants always seem happy from such a distance,but <entidade "Rhaegar Targaryen">Rhaegar</entidade> actually liked to leave the <entidade "Red Keep">Red Keep</entidade> and mingle with the common people on the streets.
<entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> accompanied him often to guard him,and says that <entidade "Rhaegar Targaryen">Rhaegar</entidade> liked to sing to people.
He was a great singer,so he would find a place on one of the streets just like any public minstrel and sing.
He liked to see how much money he could make,and everyone enjoyed his singing,so he often made quite a lot.
<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> is surprised,because her brother <entidade "Viserys">Viserys</entidade> only told her that <entidade "Rhaegar Targaryen">Rhaegar</entidade> was a great killer.

An injured <entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade> continues to fight the <entidade "Sons of the Harpy">Sons of the Harpy</entidade>.
<entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> scoffs that <entidade "Rhaegar Targaryen">Rhaegar</entidade> was a great warrior but never enjoyed killing,he was a gentle man who enjoyed singing.
She asks what they did with all the money,and <entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> says that they did all sorts of things : sometimes they just gave it to the next minstrel on the road,once <entidade "Rhaegar Targaryen">Rhaegar</entidade> gave it all to an orphanage in the slums of <entidade "Flea Bottom">Flea Bottom</entidade>,and one time they spent it to get horribly drunk.
<entidade "Daario Naharis">Daario Naharis</entidade> then comes to say that the day's supplicants are waiting in the throne room,chief among them <entidade "Hizdahr">Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade "Loraq">Loraq</entidade>.
<entidade "Aware">Aware</entidade> of his dislike of politics,<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> asks if <entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> wants to attend her in the throne room ; after being assured that <entidade "Daario Naharis">Daario</entidade> has her back,she gives him the day off,cheerfully telling him to make some music in the city below.
<entidade "Hizdahr">Hizdahr</entidade> again beseeches <entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> to reopen the fighting pits of <entidade "Meereen">Meereen</entidade>,because today is the traditional beginning of the fighting season.
<entidade "Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</entidade> again refuses,but <entidade "Hizdahr">Hizdahr</entidade> rationally argues that the fighting pits provide a great spectacle that has always been enjoyed by both the slave-masters and slaves,and is one of the few things that can bring the city together.
Bringing back this major tradition will not instantly solve all of her problems,he concedes,but it would be a start at mending together her subjects.

<entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade> runs towards danger.
As he speaks,the <entidade "Sons of the Harpy">Sons of the Harpy</entidade> are already mounting a series of large-scale attacks in the streets.
A Meereenese prostitute helps them distract and kill some of the <entidade "Second Sons">Second Sons</entidade>,and when a patrol of <entidade "Unsullied">Unsullied</entidade> arrives,she feigns fear and directs them into a trap by pointing that the <entidade "Sons of the Harpy">Sons of the Harpy</entidade> ran into a narrow alleyway.
The <entidade "Unsullied">Unsullied</entidade> give chase,only to be surrounded by a much larger number of the <entidade "Sons of the Harpy">Sons of the Harpy</entidade>.
Brutal fighting rages throughout the streets of <entidade "Meereen">Meereen</entidade>.
<entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade> is among the ambushed <entidade "Unsullied">Unsullied</entidade> ; he kills many attackers,though he loses his helmet,is slashed in the leg,and is stabbed in his side.
<entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade> pulls the dagger out of himself,stabs a foe in the throat with it,and keeps fighting,though his wounds slow him considerably.
Most of the <entidade "Sons of the Harpy">Sons of the Harpy</entidade> are dead but they outnumber the <entidade "Unsullied">Unsullied</entidade> so much to begin with that only <entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade> is left.
Just then,<entidade "Barristan Selmy">Ser Barristan</entidade> arrives and saves <entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade> by drawing the attention of the remaining rebels.
He takes on eight Sons of the <entidade "Harpy">Harpy</entidade> and defeats them all,save for the last one,who stabs him in the belly.
He falls to his knees and just as his attacker is about to slit his throat,<entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade> takes him out by shoving his spear into his back.
<entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade> staggers over <entidade "Barristan Selmy">Barristan</entidade>,but he has lost consciousness.
Severely wounded,<entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade> then slumps down to the floor next to him.
