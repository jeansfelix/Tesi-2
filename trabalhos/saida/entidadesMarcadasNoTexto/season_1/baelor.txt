In the Riverlands 
Theon and  Robb outside the Twins.
<entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade>'s army has reached the <entidade " Twins"> Twins</entidade>,the heavily-fortified crossing over the Green <entidade " Fork of Trident River"> Fork of Trident River</entidade>.
<entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon Greyjoy</entidade> shoots down messenger ravens,so no word of their presence can be relayed,but finds nothing more but messages to extended family members.
To enter the castle would be perilous for <entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade>,so <entidade " Catelyn Stark"> Catelyn Stark</entidade> enters to negotiate their crossing the river.
Though held by <entidade " House Frey"> House Frey</entidade>,bannermen to <entidade " Catelyn Stark"> Catelyn Stark</entidade>'s father,<entidade " Lord Walder Frey"> Lord Walder Frey</entidade> has not yet taken up arms.
When called up,he says he had been preparing to march,and was just waiting for all his forces to arrive.
In reality,he waited to see which side was winning before deciding whether to get involved.
Now,as the <entidade " Tully"> Tully</entidade>'s army has been defeated and <entidade " Riverrun"> Riverrun</entidade> is held by the <entidade " Lannisters"> Lannisters</entidade>,he wants to know why he should be helping <entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade> and taking up arms against the king.
After some hard bargaining between <entidade " Catelyn Stark"> Catelyn</entidade> and <entidade " Walder Frey"> Walder</entidade>,they strike a deal : the <entidade " Freys"> Freys</entidade> will join <entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade>'s cause,allow him to cross and commit troops to his army,but in return both <entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade> and <entidade " Arya"> Arya</entidade> must each marry one of <entidade " Walder Frey"> Walder</entidade>'s own children.
<entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade> agrees,though noting that <entidade " Arya"> Arya</entidade> won't like it.
<entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade> must also take <entidade " Olyvar Frey"> Olyvar Frey</entidade> as a squire.
The <entidade " Lannisters"> Lannister</entidade> armies prepare for battle.
<entidade " Tywin"> Tywin</entidade> tells his son Tyrion that he means to use the hill tribe forces to give them an edge against the <entidade " Stark"> Stark</entidade> army,essentially to be used as cannon fodder.
He orders <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> to lead them from the front of the vanguard.
<entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> angrily accuses his father of trying to kill him.
He storms back to his tent to find that <entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> has found him,as per instruction,a whore named <entidade " Shae"> Shae</entidade>.
<entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> takes an immediate liking to her.
When told they go into battle in the vanguard in the morning,<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> goes off to find one for himself.
Tyrion,<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade>,and <entidade " Shae"> Shae</entidade> play a drinking game the night before the battle.
Tyrion makes observations and if he is correct the person has to drink.
He guesses correctly that <entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> has been beyond the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> and killed someone before he was twelve years old ( though it was a woman,not a man,and he killed her in self-defense,because she was coming at him with an axe ).
Tyrion guesses that <entidade " Shae"> Shae</entidade>'s mother was a whore,her father deserted them,and she is low born - however he is wrong on each guess.
Tyrion can not read <entidade " Shae"> Shae</entidade>'s personality,but this only makes her more intriguing to him.
When <entidade " Shae"> Shae</entidade> starts to question <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade>,<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> reveals that he heard <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> was once married.
Reluctantly,<entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> explains that when he was very young,he and <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> were out riding near <entidade " Casterly Rock"> Casterly Rock</entidade> and found a young common girl in distress from bandits.
While <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> chased the bandits off,<entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> comforted the girl,whose name was <entidade " Tysha"> Tysha</entidade>.
They ended up getting drunk at a local inn,and she became so enamored of him that <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade> felt like he wasn't an ugly dwarf.
Later that night she had sex with <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade>,the first time he was ever with a woman.
Tyrion fell madly in love,and bribed a drunken septon to marry them in secret.

However,two weeks later his father <entidade " Tywin"> Tywin</entidade> found out,and was utterly furious that his son had married a commoner.
<entidade " Tywin"> Tywin</entidade> forced <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> to reveal the truth : the girl was a prostitute and <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> set the situation up to do something nice for his little brother.
<entidade " Tywin"> Tywin</entidade> then instructed his guards to have sex with her,with her being paid a silver coin for each man,while Tyrion was forced to watch.
<entidade " Shae"> Shae</entidade> points out that Tyrion was foolish to believe a woman would sleep with him just hours after almost being raped.
As she gets romantic with <entidade " Tyrion"> Tyrion</entidade>,<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> leaves the tent.
Tyrion <entidade " Lannisters"> Lannister</entidade> leads the hill tribes into battle.
The next morning the <entidade " Lannisters"> Lannister</entidade> army finds that the <entidade " Starks"> Starks</entidade> have stolen a march on them ; they are about to be attacked and have to hastily prepare for battle.
Tyrion gives a rousing speech to his hill tribesmen,but as they charge for the front he is first nearly trampled and then knocked out by an accidental blow to the head from someone's club.
When he regains consciousness on the back of a wagon,<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade> tells him that the <entidade " Lannisters"> Lannisters</entidade> won the battle,but it was a feint.
As a diversion,<entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade> sent a small portion of his army to confront and delay <entidade " Tywin"> Tywin</entidade>'s forces,while the main army marched on <entidade " Riverrun"> Riverrun</entidade> to attack <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade>'s army.
<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> is captured by <entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade>'s army.
<entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb Stark</entidade> after his victory.
<entidade " Catelyn Stark"> Catelyn</entidade> and <entidade " Ser Rodrik Cassel"> Ser Rodrik Cassel</entidade> are waiting in woodlands as they hear sounds of battle.
Suddenly <entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb</entidade> returns from his victory with his guards and a prisoner,<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> himself.
The <entidade " Battle of the Whispering Wood"> Battle of the Whispering Wood</entidade> has lifted the siege of <entidade " Riverrun"> Riverrun</entidade>,and <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade>'s army has been destroyed.
Jaime suggests they end the war now with a bout of single combat between himself and <entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb</entidade>,but <entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb</entidade> refuses and has him imprisoned.
<entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb</entidade> laments that his diversion sent 2,000 men to their deaths.
He gives a speech to his army and tells them that they have won a great victory,but the war is far from over.

<entidade " Maester Aemon"> Maester Aemon</entidade> reveals his true identity.
<entidade " Mormont"> Mormont</entidade> explains to Jon that <entidade " Longclaw"> Longclaw</entidade> was meant for his own son,<entidade " Ser Jorah Mormont"> Ser Jorah Mormont</entidade>,but he disgraced himself and fled in exile to <entidade " Essos"> Essos</entidade>.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> goes to the dining hall and the other recruits make a fuss over the sword,but <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Samwell Tarly</entidade> seems distant from the revelry.
<entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> takes <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> aside and informs him about <entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb</entidade> leading an army south to war.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> ponders that he should be with him,but <entidade " Maester Aemon"> Maester Aemon</entidade> tells him their duty to the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> comes first.
To <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade>'s surprise,<entidade " Aemon"> Aemon</entidade> reveals that his full name is <entidade " Aemon Targaryen"> Aemon Targaryen</entidade>,the son of a king,brother to another,the uncle of the <entidade " Mad King"> Mad King</entidade>.
<entidade " Aemon Targaryen"> Aemon</entidade> had to stand aside and do nothing while his entire family was butchered or exiled during <entidade " Robert's Rebellion"> Robert's Rebellion</entidade>.
It is not an easy life they have chosen.
<entidade " Aemon Targaryen"> Aemon</entidade> remarks that he can not make <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> stay or go ; like the <entidade " Maester Aemon"> Maester</entidade>,<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> must make the choice himself,and live with the consequences of it for the rest of his life.

Across the <entidade " Narrow Sea"> Narrow Sea</entidade>

Far to the east,<entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> is concerned that the wound her husband <entidade " Khal Drogo"> Khal Drogo</entidade> took fighting <entidade " Mago"> Mago</entidade> has festered and become infected.
He falls from his horse,a grave sign of weakness amongst the <entidade " Dothraki"> Dothraki</entidade>.
<entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> tells the khalasar that they are stopping and requests for <entidade " Qotho"> Qotho</entidade> to get <entidade " Mirri Maz Duur"> Mirri Maz Duur</entidade> to help <entidade " Drogo"> Drogo</entidade>.
<entidade " Qotho"> Qotho</entidade> is unhappy with entrusting <entidade " Drogo"> Drogo</entidade>'s care to the woman,whom he calls a maegi or witch,but relents.
At <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade>' request,<entidade " Ser Jorah Mormont"> Ser Jorah</entidade> armors himself.
<entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> also advises her to leave now,because <entidade " Drogo"> Drogo</entidade> is certain to die and when he dies,his lieutenants will fight amongst themselves to be his successor ; whoever wins will kill <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade>'s son,rather than risk the boy growing up to be a rival,but <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> refuses to abandon her husband.
<entidade " Mirri Maz Duur"> Mirri Maz Duur</entidade> promises to save <entidade " Drogo"> Drogo</entidade>'s life,but she needs to sacrifice a life in exchange.
She takes <entidade " Drogo"> Drogo</entidade>'s horse into his tent and starts the ceremony,slitting the animal's throat over <entidade " Drogo"> Drogo</entidade>'s comatose form.

<entidade " Jorah Mormont"> Jorah Mormont</entidade> helps <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade>.

Daenerys starts to go into labor,but none of the <entidade " Dothraki"> Dothraki</entidade> midwives will help her,thinking she is cursed.
With no choice,<entidade " Jorah Mormont"> Jorah</entidade> takes <entidade " Daenerys Targaryen"> Daenerys</entidade> into the tent as the ceremony continues.

In <entidade " King"> King</entidade>'s Landing 
<entidade " Varys"> Varys</entidade> visits <entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard Stark</entidade> in the dungeons under the <entidade " Red Keep"> Red Keep</entidade>.
<entidade " Varys"> Varys</entidade> tells  Eddard that Sansa begged for his life before the whole court and that <entidade " Robb"> Robb</entidade> is leading an army from the <entidade " North"> North</entidade>.
In addition,the <entidade " Queen"> Queen</entidade> is more concerned over the intentions of <entidade " King Robert"> King Robert</entidade>'s brother,<entidade " Stannis"> Stannis</entidade>,a proven battle commander known to be without mercy.
For the sake of <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade>'s life,<entidade " Varys"> Varys</entidade> urges <entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard</entidade> to confess to treason.
In return,<entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> will let him take the black and join his younger brother <entidade " Benjen"> Benjen</entidade> and bastard son <entidade " Jon Snow on the Wall"> Jon Snow on the Wall</entidade>.
<entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard</entidade> is angered by the suggestion that he would trade in his honesty and honor for his life,though he appears to have second thoughts when <entidade " Varys"> Varys</entidade> insinuates that <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> would pay the price for his defiance.
<entidade " Arya Stark"> Arya Stark</entidade> is living rough on the streets of the city.
She catches a pigeon and tries to trade it for a slice of bread,to no avail.
She sees crowds moving through the streets and is told that the <entidade " Hand of the King"> Hand of the King</entidade> is being brought before the <entidade " Great Sept of Baelor"> Great Sept of Baelor</entidade>,the center of religious worship in the city.
Stunned that she will see her father she drops the pigeon and joins the crowd.
Unable to see,she climbs unto the pedestal of a statue of <entidade " Baelor"> Baelor</entidade> ( a previous <entidade " Targaryen"> Targaryen</entidade> king,<entidade " Baelor"> Baelor</entidade> the <entidade " Blessed"> Blessed</entidade>,for whom the <entidade " Sept"> Sept</entidade> is named ).
She sees her father being brought in chains to the steps of the temple.

<entidade " Lord Eddard"> Lord Eddard</entidade> looks at the statue and says,<entidade " Baelor"> Baelor</entidade>,puzzling the crowd.
<entidade " Yoren of the Night"> Yoren</entidade> understands,however,and moves toward the statue where <entidade " Arya Stark"> Arya</entidade> is watching.
<entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard</entidade> is given a chance to confess his crimes.
He weighs his choices as he sees both <entidade " Arya Stark"> Arya</entidade> and <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> present,and chooses to save them by making a false confession.
He says that <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> is the true <entidade " King on the Iron Throne"> King on the Iron Throne</entidade>,pleasing him.
<entidade " Grand Maester Pycelle"> Grand Maester Pycelle</entidade> extols the virtues of mercy and <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> agrees that he could be merciful and send <entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard</entidade> to the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> as his mother has suggested and as <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> has begged.
He instead acknowledges that as women they are soft and treason must never go unpunished.
He commands <entidade " Ser Ilyn Payne"> Ser Ilyn Payne</entidade> to bring him the traitor's head.

<entidade " Ser Ilyn Payne"> Ser Ilyn Payne</entidade> executes <entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard Stark</entidade>.
The crowd goes into an uproar.
<entidade " Arya Stark"> Arya</entidade> tries to make her way through the crowd drawing her sword to save her father,but <entidade " Yoren of the Night"> Yoren</entidade> grabs and stops her,shielding her from seeing her father's death.
<entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> screams and is restrained by guards.
A visibly horrified <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> frantically tries to persuade her son to reconsider,as does <entidade " Varys"> Varys</entidade>,but there is no time.
Forced to kneel,<entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard</entidade> looks at the statue and sees that <entidade " Arya Stark"> Arya</entidade> has been rescued by <entidade " Yoren of the Night"> Yoren</entidade>,and is relieved that she is safe.
<entidade " Ser Ilyn Payne"> Ser Ilyn</entidade> draws <entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard</entidade>'s own sword,<entidade " Ice"> Ice</entidade>,and cuts his head off with a single blow.
A flock of pigeons takes flight immediately afterwards,the sight being all <entidade " Arya Stark"> Arya</entidade> needs to know her father is dead.
