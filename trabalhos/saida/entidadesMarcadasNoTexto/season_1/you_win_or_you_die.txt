<entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard Stark</entidade>'s investigations in <entidade " King's Landing"> King's Landing</entidade> reach a dramatic climax as he confronts Queen <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> with his findings.
<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin Lannister</entidade> prepares his forces for battle and gives <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> an important assignment.

<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon Snow</entidade> finally takes his place amongst the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade>.

At the <entidade " Lannister Camp"> Lannister Camp</entidade> 
On the borders of the <entidade " Riverlands"> Riverlands</entidade>,<entidade " Lord Tywin Lannister"> Lord Tywin Lannister</entidade> has assembled an army of sixty thousand men,with which he plans to oppose the <entidade " Starks"> Starks</entidade> and punish <entidade " Catelyn"> Catelyn</entidade>'s capture of his son <entidade " Tyrion Lannister"> Tyrion Lannister</entidade>.

<entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> discusses the future of <entidade " House Lannister"> House Lannister</entidade> with his son <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade>.
As he stands in his tent skinning a dead stag,he tells his elder son,<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade>,that this conflict will decide the fate of their family ; they will either forge a dynasty that will last a thousand years or cease to exist,as the <entidade " Targaryens"> Targaryens</entidade> had done.
He orders <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> to become the man he was meant to be,and to take thirty thousand men and besiege <entidade " Riverrun"> Riverrun</entidade>,<entidade " Catelyn"> Catelyn</entidade>'s childhood home and the seat of <entidade " House Tully"> House Tully</entidade>.
<entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> ponders why <entidade " Tywin Lannister"> Tywin</entidade> would risk so much for the ugly,stunted son that he hates,but to Tywin a <entidade " Lannister Camp"> Lannister</entidade> is a <entidade " Lannister Camp"> Lannister</entidade> - even though he considers <entidade " Tyrion Lannister"> Tyrion</entidade> the least worthy member of their family,any affront to their family must be punished or it makes them look weak.

In the <entidade " North"> North</entidade> 
Theon attempts to intimidate <entidade " Osha"> Osha</entidade>.
In <entidade " Winterfell"> Winterfell</entidade>,<entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon Greyjoy</entidade> attempts to bully <entidade " Osha"> Osha</entidade>,the wildling woman captured in the recent raid.
He insists that she refer to him as <entidade " My Lord"> My Lord</entidade>,but she is unimpressed with his antics.
She points out that he is not entitled to this,as his father is still alive.
<entidade " Maester Luwin"> Maester Luwin</entidade> dismisses <entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon</entidade> and questions Osha about why her band crossed the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> and were fleeing as far south as south goes.
She claims that the <entidade " White"> White</entidade> <entidade " Walkers"> Walkers</entidade> have awoken after a millennia asleep and are coming south,to <entidade " Luwin"> Luwin</entidade>'s skepticism.

At the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> 
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon Snow</entidade> and <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Samwell Tarly</entidade> are standing watch atop the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> when <entidade " Benjen"> Benjen</entidade>'s horse is spotted returning,but,to <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade>'s horror,there is no sign of <entidade " Benjen"> Benjen</entidade> himself.
Later on,<entidade " Lord Commander Jeor Mormont"> Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</entidade> names the trainees as men of the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade>.
He hands out assignments,but to <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade>'s disgust he is being sent to the stewards,not the rangers.
He will work directly for the <entidade " Lord Commander Jeor Mormont"> Lord Commander</entidade> as his personal steward.
His attempts to plead his case to <entidade " Maester Aemon"> Maester Aemon</entidade> ( who has selected <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Samwell</entidade> as his own steward ) are met with indifference.
However,<entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> suggests to Jon that while this move was possibly orchestrated by <entidade " Ser Alliser Thorne"> Ser Alliser Thorne</entidade> to punish <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade>,it is also an opportunity for the <entidade " Lord Commander Jeor Mormont"> Lord Commander</entidade> to groom <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> directly for command.
Both are then surprised when <entidade " Pypar"> Pypar</entidade> admits that he was sent to the <entidade " Watch"> Watch</entidade> for refusing to give sexual favors to a lord,not for stealing a wheel of cheese to feed his sister as he had previously claimed.
Nothing about being sent to the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> is fair.

<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon Snow</entidade> and <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Samwell Tarly</entidade> swear their oaths to the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade>.
<entidade " Convinced"> Convinced</entidade>,<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade>,along with <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade>,say their oath of fealty to the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> in front of a heart tree just inside the eaves of the <entidade " Haunted Forest"> Haunted Forest</entidade> and are acknowledged as men of the <entidade " Watch"> Watch</entidade>.
<entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> decided to take the oath with <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> to the <entidade " Old Gods of the Forest"> Old Gods of the Forest</entidade>,as the <entidade " Seven"> Seven</entidade> gods his father worshiped have never seemed to answer him.
After they take their oaths,<entidade " Ghost"> Ghost</entidade> finds a severed hand in the woods and brings it back to <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> and a horrified <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade>.

He says that a man doesn't need an iron chair but only a horse.

<entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> is delivered a message from <entidade " Varys"> Varys</entidade>,a royal pardon for his crimes ; he quickly realizes that this news would only come if he was no longer needed as a spy.
Seeing <entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> with a wineseller who is keen for her to try a particular vintage from the <entidade " Arbor"> Arbor</entidade>,<entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> realizes that the wine has been poisoned ; this is the assassination attempt.

The wineseller attempts to flee,but <entidade " Rakharo"> Rakharo</entidade> brings him down with a bolo tangling his ankles.
With the wine seller captured,<entidade " Ser Jorah Mormont"> Ser Jorah</entidade> tells  Daenerys that Robert Baratheon will never stop trying to kill her and her future children.

Cersei does not deny the charge and in fact is proud of it,comparing their love to the old <entidade " Targaryen"> Targaryen</entidade> practice of marrying brother to sister ; she also admits to having despised <entidade " Robert"> Robert</entidade> ever since their wedding night,when <entidade " Robert"> Robert</entidade> drunkenly stumbled into <entidade " Cersei Lannister"> Cersei</entidade>'s bed and called her <entidade " Lyanna"> Lyanna</entidade>.
<entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> angrily tells her to take her children and leave the city immediately.
When <entidade " Robert"> Robert</entidade> returns from his hunt,he will tell him the truth of the matter and <entidade " Cersei Lannister"> Cersei</entidade> should run as far as she can before that happens,lest <entidade " Robert"> Robert</entidade>'s wrath find her.

In one of his brothels,<entidade " Littlefinger"> Littlefinger</entidade> instructs the newly-arrived <entidade " Ros"> Ros</entidade> and another prostitute,<entidade " Armeca"> Armeca</entidade>,on how to please their customers and make them happy.

He tells them about his past,how he loved and fought a duel for a woman.
He lost and subsequently realized that he could never beat those in power by honorable means,as they would never let him compete on equal terms.
When <entidade " Ros"> Ros</entidade> asks him what he wants,he says,<entidade " Oh"> Oh</entidade>,everything.

<entidade " Robert Baratheon"> Robert Baratheon</entidade> signs a document confirming <entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard Stark</entidade> as <entidade " Protector of the Realm"> Protector of the Realm</entidade>.
Renly finds <entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard</entidade> and tells him that <entidade " Robert Baratheon"> Robert</entidade> has been badly mauled by a boar and is not expected to survive.
<entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard</entidade> finds <entidade " Robert Baratheon"> Robert</entidade> telling <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> that he wishes he could have been a better father to him.

<entidade " Littlefinger"> Littlefinger</entidade> then arrives and talks to <entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard</entidade>,who tells him the truth about <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade>'s parentage.
<entidade " Littlefinger"> Littlefinger</entidade> suggests that they keep quiet,acknowledge <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> as king and make him their puppet.
