King <entidade " Robert Baratheon"> Robert Baratheon</entidade> hosts a grand tourney for <entidade " Eddard Stark"> Eddard</entidade>'s investiture as <entidade " Hand of the King"> Hand of the King</entidade>,to <entidade " Ned"> Ned</entidade>'s discomfort.
<entidade " Catelyn"> Catelyn</entidade> and <entidade " Ser Rodrik Cassel"> Ser Rodrik Cassel</entidade> stop at the <entidade " Crossroads Inn"> Crossroads Inn</entidade>.

In the <entidade " North"> North</entidade> 
Tyrion speaks with <entidade " Bran"> Bran</entidade>.
In <entidade " Winterfell"> Winterfell</entidade>,<entidade " Bran Stark"> Bran Stark</entidade> has a nightmare in which he sees a three-eyed raven,sitting on one of the stone direwolves outside the doorway to the <entidade " Stark"> Stark</entidade> crypts.
He wakes up to find his direwolf <entidade " Summer"> Summer</entidade> by his side.
<entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon Greyjoy</entidade> summons <entidade " Hodor"> Hodor</entidade>,the castle's dim-witted stableboy,who can only say the word <entidade " Hodor"> Hodor</entidade>,to help carry <entidade " Bran Stark"> Bran</entidade> down to the great hall,where <entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb Stark</entidade> is hosting a meeting with <entidade " Tyrion Lannister"> Tyrion Lannister</entidade> and <entidade " Yoren"> Yoren</entidade>,both traveling down from the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> to <entidade " King's Landing"> King's Landing</entidade> together.
<entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb</entidade> very pointedly offers hospitality to any man of the <entidade " Watch"> Watch</entidade>,silently letting Tyrion know he is not invited to stay at <entidade " Winterfell"> Winterfell</entidade>.
When <entidade " Bran Stark"> Bran</entidade> arrives,<entidade " Tyrion Lannister"> Tyrion</entidade> sympathizes with <entidade " Bran Stark"> Bran</entidade> for being a cripple,which annoys <entidade " Bran Stark"> Bran</entidade>,as does asking him if he likes to ride,but <entidade " Tyrion Lannister"> Tyrion</entidade> simply says it is the truth,no less so for being a hard truth.
He gives the <entidade " Starks"> Starks</entidade> the design of a saddle which will allow <entidade " Bran Stark"> Bran</entidade> to ride even in his current state.
He does it to repay <entidade " Bran Stark"> Bran</entidade>'s half-brother's friendship and because he has a weakness for,<entidade " Cripples"> Cripples</entidade>,bastards and broken things.
Due to this kindness,<entidade " Robb Stark"> Robb</entidade> says he can stay,but <entidade " Tyrion Lannister"> Tyrion</entidade> says he would prefer the brothel in town.
While preparing to leave the castle,<entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon</entidade> comes to <entidade " Tyrion Lannister"> Tyrion</entidade> and rather condescendingly sends him off,recommending the prostitute <entidade " Ros"> Ros</entidade> at the brothel.
Tyrion asks <entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon</entidade> why <entidade " Lady Catelyn"> Lady Catelyn</entidade> was not present to receive him and concludes that <entidade " Catelyn"> Catelyn</entidade> is not in <entidade " Winterfell"> Winterfell</entidade>.
He also taunts Theon about how the son of the ferocious <entidade " Balon Greyjoy"> Balon Greyjoy</entidade> has been reduced to playing lackey in <entidade " Winterfell"> Winterfell</entidade> to his captors,which infuriates <entidade " Theon Greyjoy"> Theon</entidade> and gives him a coin,assuming that he has not already had sex with <entidade " Ros"> Ros</entidade>.

At the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> 
<entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Samwell Tarly</entidade> joins the new recruits at <entidade " Castle Black"> Castle Black</entidade>.
At <entidade " Castle Black"> Castle Black</entidade>,a new recruit for the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> has arrived : <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Samwell Tarly</entidade>,the son of the famous <entidade " Lord Randyll Tarly"> Lord Randyll Tarly</entidade>.
<entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Samwell</entidade> is fat,soft and pampered,and in his first practice fight does dismally.
<entidade " Ser Alliser Thorne"> Ser Alliser Thorne</entidade> has no time for his weakness.
He directs the other recruits to attack'Ser <entidade " Piggy"> Piggy</entidade>',but <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon Snow</entidade> finds this cruel and unfair,and takes pity on <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> and fends off the attackers.
Thorne tries to turn it into a game,ordering three trainees take on <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade>'s protector ( taunting <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> that he has found a new <entidade " Lady Catelyn"> Lady</entidade> love ),but <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> nevertheless fends them all off.
<entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Samwell</entidade> is naive and self-deprecating,claiming to be a coward and craven,to <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade>'s astonishment.
No one admits to being a coward,and <entidade " Grenn"> Grenn</entidade> says that they shouldn't even be seen talking to him.
<entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> joins <entidade " Jon on the Wall"> Jon on the Wall</entidade> for sentry duty,even though he says his eyesight is weak,he is afraid of heights,and can't take the cold.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> asks why he joined the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade> as he is afraid of everything.
<entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> tells him that on his eighteenth nameday his father offered him a choice.
<entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> was a man and his heir,but he was not skilled at combat,he was unworthy of his name and birthright.
Samwall's father forced him to join the <entidade " Night's Watch"> Night's Watch</entidade>,and told him that if he refused,he would arrange a hunting trip with his son in the woods,and implied that <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> would be killed in a way that looked accidental.
<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> is shocked that a true born son of high birth should be treated worse than he himself had been as a bastard.
<entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> knows that the next day he will be made to fight again and expects it to be bad.

<entidade " Grenn"> Grenn</entidade> yields to <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Samwell</entidade>.
At the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade>,<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> orders the recruits to go easy on <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade>,but <entidade " Rast"> Rast</entidade> refuses,saying that if <entidade " Ser Alliser Thorne"> Ser Alliser</entidade> orders him to fight'Lady <entidade " Piggy"> Piggy</entidade>',he will slice himself off a side of bacon.
In response to <entidade " Rast"> Rast</entidade>'s comments,<entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> goes to his bed that night and uses his direwolf <entidade " Ghost"> Ghost</entidade> to intimidate <entidade " Rast"> Rast</entidade> into playing along.
The next day,no one will fight <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade>.
After <entidade " Grenn"> Grenn</entidade> takes a very weak blow from <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> and yields,<entidade " Ser Alliser Thorne"> Ser Alliser</entidade> scolds <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> for his rebellious actions.
Later,when <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> and <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> are cleaning the dining hall,they talk about how neither of them have been with a woman.
<entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> tells <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> that he has not had success with girls,while <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> reveals he'd rather not risk siring a child that will have the life of a bastard like himself.
A furious <entidade " Alliser Thorne"> Alliser Thorne</entidade> comes in and tells <entidade " Jon Snow"> Jon</entidade> that this charity won't help <entidade " Samwell Tarly"> Sam</entidade> harden up to survive the winter that is coming.
He tells them the truly horrific experience he went through trapped by a blizzard north of the <entidade " Wall"> Wall</entidade> that ended in cannibalism.
Across the <entidade " Narrow Sea"> Narrow Sea</entidade> 
<entidade " Khal Drogo"> Khal Drogo</entidade>'s khalasar arrives at <entidade " Vaes Dothrak"> Vaes Dothrak</entidade>,the <entidade " Dothraki"> Dothraki</entidade> city.
There are no city walls,but there is a large gateway arch made of two statues of rearing horses.
<entidade " Viserys"> Viserys</entidade> is annoyed that <entidade " Drogo"> Drogo</entidade> has been taking'his' army in the wrong direction.
Later,he bathes with <entidade " Doreah"> Doreah</entidade> and tells her about how he was raised with stories about the <entidade " Targaryen"> Targaryen</entidade> dragons and his own destiny.
He recites the names of several dragons,and tells her about the skulls of dragons that once decorated the throne room at <entidade " King's Landing"> King's Landing</entidade>,but she starts to annoy him with talk of dragons,reminding him that they are dead.
He tells her to finish pleasuring him in silence.
<entidade " Viserys"> Viserys</entidade> is enraged when <entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> sends <entidade " Doreah"> Doreah</entidade> with an invite for him to dine with her,as he interprets this as his sister commanding him to come.
He drags  Doreah into Daenerys' tent,and insults her dinner and the gifts of clothes she tries to give him.
He is still dressed in his now ragged clothes from <entidade " Pentos"> Pentos</entidade>,having refused to dress like a <entidade " Dothraki"> Dothraki</entidade>,whom he regards as savage pordh.
He sneers that next she will try to braid his hair like a <entidade " Dothraki"> Dothraki</entidade>.
<entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> retorts that he has no right to braid his hair until he is victorious in battle,which further infuriates him.
In his anger,<entidade " Viserys"> Viserys</entidade> tackles her to the ground and tries to strike her,calling her nothing but a horselord's slut,and warning her that she's awoken the <entidade " Dragon"> Dragon</entidade>,but this time she fights back,hitting him in the face with a metal and leather belt.
She tells a thunderstruck Viserys that she is the <entidade " Khal Drogo"> Khal</entidade>'s wife,and is carrying his child ( and by implication,<entidade " Viserys"> Viserys</entidade> is nothing to the <entidade " Dothraki"> Dothraki</entidade> ),and warns that if he raises a hand against her again,he will lose his hands.
Later,<entidade " Daenerys"> Daenerys</entidade> confides in <entidade " Mormont"> Mormont</entidade> her realization that <entidade " Viserys"> Viserys</entidade> will never become <entidade " King of Westeros"> King of Westeros</entidade>.
He is so weak and ineffectual that he couldn't command an army even if <entidade " Drogo"> Drogo</entidade> gave him one,to which <entidade " Jorah"> Jorah</entidade> agrees.

In <entidade " King's Landing"> King</entidade>'s Landing 
In the <entidade " Red Keep"> Red Keep</entidade>,<entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa Stark</entidade> visits the <entidade " Great Hall"> Great Hall</entidade>,where the <entidade " Iron Throne"> Iron Throne</entidade> sits.
She and <entidade " Septa Mordane"> Septa Mordane</entidade> discuss the expectation that <entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade> will have to provide <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> with an heir.
<entidade " Sansa Stark"> Sansa</entidade> thinks the realm will hate her if she only has daughters,along with her belief <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> is still angry over the incident by the river and her anger at her father over <entidade " Lady"> Lady</entidade>'s death.

The small council meets.
During a meeting of the small council,<entidade " Lord Eddard"> Lord Eddard</entidade> learns that the forthcoming tournament to celebrate his appointment is seeing the city swell with visitors,and has already resulted in a tavern riot,a brothel fire,three stabbings and a drunken horse race.
He tells Littlefinger that money will have to be found to strengthen the city guards,as well as giving twenty of his own men to <entidade " Janos Slynt"> Janos Slynt</entidade>'s command,until the tournament is over.
After the meeting <entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> talks to  Grand Maester Pycelle about Jon Arryn's last few weeks.
<entidade " Pycelle"> Pycelle</entidade> said he did all he could to save <entidade " Jon Arryn"> Jon Arryn</entidade>,but the illness was sudden and severe.
He recalls that shortly before his sudden illness,<entidade " Arryn"> Arryn</entidade> had borrowed a truly boring book about the lineages of the <entidade " Seven Kingdoms"> Seven Kingdoms</entidade>,and his last words were,The seed is strong.
Taking the book with him,<entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> comes across <entidade " Arya"> Arya</entidade> in the hall standing on one leg as part of her training with <entidade " Syrio"> Syrio</entidade>.
<entidade " Arya"> Arya</entidade> asks whether <entidade " Bran"> Bran</entidade> would be able to live in <entidade " King of Westeros"> King</entidade>'s Landing with them now that he's awoken,but <entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> states that he would have to regain his strength first.
<entidade " Arya"> Arya</entidade> then comments that <entidade " Bran"> Bran</entidade> had always wanted to be a knight in the <entidade " King's Guard"> King's Guard</entidade>,but will no longer be able to due to his paralysis.
Eddard confirms this to be the case,but states that <entidade " Bran"> Bran</entidade> will be able to do many other things such as become lord of a holdfast,sit on the <entidade " King of Westeros"> King</entidade>'s council,or raise castles.
When <entidade " Arya"> Arya</entidade> asks if she would be able to become any of those,<entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> instead tells her that she will marry a highborn lord and have lords and princes for sons.
However,<entidade " Arya"> Arya</entidade> is not pleased with this response,telling her father,that's not me.
She goes back to balancing on one leg as <entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> looks on.

<entidade " Petyr"> Petyr</entidade> talks with <entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade>.
<entidade " Littlefinger"> Littlefinger</entidade> meets with <entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> and suggests that he keep his investigation into <entidade " Jon Arryn"> Jon Arryn</entidade>'s death lower in profile.
He also gives <entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> some interesting intelligence : <entidade " Jon Arryn"> Jon Arryn</entidade>'s former squire has been knighted and will fight in the forthcoming <entidade " Hand"> Hand</entidade>'s tourney.
He also advises him to investigate an armorer located in the city.
<entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> decides that <entidade " Littlefinger"> Littlefinger</entidade> may be more trustworthy than he first thought,but <entidade " Littlefinger"> Littlefinger</entidade> discourages him from thinking that way.
<entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> sends <entidade " Jory Cassel"> Jory Cassel</entidade> to question <entidade " Jon Arryn"> Jon Arryn</entidade>'s former squire,<entidade " Ser Hugh of the Vale"> Ser Hugh of the Vale</entidade>.
However,deducing that <entidade " Jory Cassel"> Jory</entidade> was not a knight,<entidade " Ser Hugh of the Vale"> Ser Hugh</entidade> simply rebuffs him and refuses to speak with him due to his much lower rank.
<entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade>'s investigation leads him to a smithy in the city,where he meets master smith <entidade " Tobho Mott"> Tobho Mott</entidade> and his apprentice <entidade " Gendry"> Gendry</entidade>,whose work <entidade " Jon Arryn"> Jon Arryn</entidade> was also apparently interested in.
<entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> realizes that <entidade " Gendry"> Gendry</entidade> is one of <entidade " King Robert"> King Robert</entidade>'s bastard sons,but can't work out why <entidade " Jon Arryn"> Jon Arryn</entidade> would be interested in this : <entidade " Robert"> Robert</entidade> has many bastard children and shows little interest in any of them.
Later,<entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> sends <entidade " Jory Cassel"> Jory</entidade> with a message for <entidade " King Robert"> King Robert</entidade>,but upon arriving at his quarters,the sounds of many women can he heard coming from <entidade " Robert"> Robert</entidade>'s chamber.
<entidade " Ser Jaime Lannister"> Ser Jaime Lannister</entidade> happens to be on duty and is angry that the king keeps him guarding his chamber while he cavorts with other women inside,flaunting his dishonorable treatment of <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade>'s sister in his face.
He and <entidade " Jory Cassel"> Jory</entidade> reminisce about the <entidade " Greyjoy Rebellion"> Greyjoy Rebellion</entidade>,in which they both fought for <entidade " King Robert"> King Robert</entidade>'s forces to put down an attempt by <entidade " Balon Greyjoy"> Balon Greyjoy</entidade> ( <entidade " Theon"> Theon</entidade>'s father ) to secede the <entidade " Iron Islands"> Iron Islands</entidade> from the rest of the realm.
<entidade " Jory Cassel"> Jory</entidade> tries to leave <entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade>'s message with <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade>,but is rebuffed,as <entidade " Jaime"> Jaime</entidade> angrily states that he does not serve <entidade " Lord Stark"> Lord Stark</entidade>.
<entidade " Littlefinger"> Littlefinger</entidade>,<entidade " Arya"> Arya</entidade>,<entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> and <entidade " Septa Mordane"> Septa Mordane</entidade> at the tournament.
The tournament begins and <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> watches from the stands.
<entidade " Ser Gregor Clegane"> Ser Gregor Clegane</entidade>,the elder brother of <entidade " Sandor Clegane"> Sandor Clegane</entidade>,the <entidade " Hound"> Hound</entidade>,takes the field.
His first joust is with <entidade " Ser Hugh of the Vale"> Ser Hugh</entidade>.
However,the friendly joust turns nasty and <entidade " Gregor kills Ser Hugh"> Gregor kills Ser Hugh</entidade> by accident,with a splinter of the lance impaling his neck.
<entidade " Littlefinger"> Littlefinger</entidade> sits next to <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade>,and remarks that she and <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> have had a lover's quarrel ( as <entidade " Joffrey"> Joffrey</entidade> is still giving her the cold shoulder ).
Baelish then tells  Sansa that Gregor,the Mountain That <entidade " Rides"> Rides</entidade>,has a dark reputation : he pushed his little brother <entidade " Sandor Clegane"> Sandor</entidade>'s face into a fire for taking and playing with a toy of his when they were young,burning him severely.
<entidade " Littlefinger"> Littlefinger</entidade> recommends that <entidade " Sansa"> Sansa</entidade> not spread that story around.
<entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> visits <entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> at his chambers,remarking at how the <entidade " Hand"> Hand</entidade> is not at his own tournament.
Though <entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> attempts to start the conversation in an attempt to put the incident on the <entidade " Kingsroad"> Kingsroad</entidade> behind them,<entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> correctly deduces that she has an ulterior motive for her visit.
<entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> then wonders aloud to Eddard what his true purpose is for being at <entidade " King's Landing"> King's Landing</entidade>,as she knows how little <entidade " Starks"> Starks</entidade> enjoy being in the capital.
When <entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> tells her he is to faithfully serve their <entidade " King Robert"> King</entidade>,<entidade " Cersei"> Cersei</entidade> remarks that as his brother <entidade " Brandon"> Brandon</entidade> was born to lead,<entidade " Eddard"> Eddard</entidade> was born to follow.

In the Riverlands 
At the <entidade " Crossroads Inn"> Crossroads Inn</entidade>,<entidade " Catelyn"> Catelyn</entidade> and <entidade " Ser Rodrik Cassel"> Ser Rodrik Cassel</entidade>,on their way home to <entidade " Winterfell"> Winterfell</entidade>,are enjoying the hospitality of the innkeeper and,more reluctantly,the attempts by the troubadour Marillion to ingratiate himself with them.
( He is doing a poor job : when he asks if they would like a song,he is refused.) 
They are surprised when <entidade " Tyrion Lannister"> Tyrion Lannister</entidade> and <entidade " Yoren"> Yoren</entidade> arrive.
When told there aren't any rooms,<entidade " Tyrion Lannister"> Tyrion</entidade> holds up a gold coin and asks if someone has a room for him.
<entidade " Quickly Tyrion"> Quickly Tyrion</entidade> gains the favor of a sellsword,<entidade " Bronn"> Bronn</entidade>,who agrees to give his room to <entidade " Tyrion Lannister"> Tyrion</entidade>.
<entidade " Marillion"> Marillion</entidade> draws the attention of <entidade " Tyrion Lannister"> Tyrion</entidade> to <entidade " Catelyn"> Catelyn</entidade>'s table,by offering to serenade him while he eats,singing of his father's military victories.
<entidade " Tyrion Lannister"> Tyrion</entidade> says nothing would more likely ruin his appetite,but as he is turning away,he recognizes <entidade " Catelyn"> Catelyn</entidade> and is surprised at this meeting by chance.
In return <entidade " Catelyn"> Catelyn</entidade> tells the stunned inn that <entidade " Tyrion Lannister"> Tyrion</entidade> tried to murder her son <entidade " Brandon"> Bran</entidade> twice and that she asks their help in bringing him to the king's justice.
The inn is located in the <entidade " Riverlands"> Riverlands</entidade>,in the territory controlled by her father,so the knights present owe him their fealty.
Tyrion finds himself surrounded by half a dozen men with swords,and in <entidade " Catelyn"> Catelyn</entidade>'s custody.
