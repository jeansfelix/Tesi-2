Synopsis 
As tragic news spreads across the <entidade "Seven Kingdoms">Seven Kingdoms</entidade>,<entidade "Bran">Bran</entidade> and <entidade "Rickon">Rickon</entidade> share a prophetic dream,<entidade "Catelyn">Catelyn</entidade> interrogates <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> about her sonʼs fall,and <entidade "Robbʼs">Robbʼs</entidade> destiny is forever changed.
After a surprising decision by his father,<entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> heads south.
<entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade> assumes a new identity in an attempt to escape <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade>,and <entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> is terrorized by <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade>.
At the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade>,<entidade "Jon">Jon</entidade> is forced to choose between the <entidade "Nightʼs Watch">Nightʼs Watch</entidade> and the family he left behind.
Across the sea,<entidade "Dany">Dany</entidade> pays a terrible price for her love,but finds new hope through her dragon eggs.

In <entidade "King's Landing">King</entidade>'s Landing 
At the <entidade "Great Sept of Baelor">Great Sept of Baelor</entidade>,<entidade "Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</entidade> has been executed by beheading ; The great sword <entidade "Ice">Ice</entidade> is covered in blood,and <entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor Clegane</entidade> standing next to <entidade "Ilyn Payne">Ser Ilyn Payne</entidade>,the royal executioner,holds <entidade "Eddard Stark">Lord Eddard</entidade>'s head up to the adulation of the baying crowd.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa Stark</entidade> has fainted.
In the crowd,<entidade "Yoren">Yoren</entidade> drags <entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade> away,making a point of calling her <entidade "Boy">Boy</entidade>.
Once he gets her out of the courtyard,he cuts her hair off with a knife.
He tells her that he will get her out of <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade> and to <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade> as a recruit of the <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade>,but he warns her not to trust the other recruits,since apparently half would hand her over to <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> for a pardon,while the other half would do the same,but only after raping her first.
<entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> is holding court and a singer is brought before him,charged with making up an amusing but offensive song about <entidade "Robert">Robert</entidade> and <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade>.
The song says that the boar might have killed <entidade "King Robert">King Robert</entidade>,but the lion in his bed had previously castrated him.
The singer turns out to be <entidade "Marillion">Marillion</entidade>,who <entidade "Catelyn">Catelyn</entidade> and <entidade "Rodrik">Ser Rodrik</entidade> met at the Inn at the Crossroads,and who accompanied them and <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> to the <entidade "Vale of Arryn">Vale of Arryn</entidade>.
<entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> asks <entidade "Marillion">Marillion</entidade> if he wants to keep his hands or tongue.
<entidade "Marillion">Marillion</entidade> fearfully responds that everyone needs hands.
<entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> commands <entidade "Ilyn Payne">Ilyn Payne</entidade> to cut out the tongue instead.
<entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> then takes <entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> up to the walls to see her father's head and makes her look at it.
He cruelly mocks her,promising he will give her <entidade "Robbʼs">Robb</entidade>'s head next.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> quietly retorts that <entidade "Robbʼs">Robb</entidade> might give her <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade>'s instead.
Infuriated,<entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> orders <entidade "Meryn Trant">Ser Meryn Trant</entidade> to beat her,as <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> has told him that a king should not hit his queen.
<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> moves up behind <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade>,apparently preparing to shove him off the walkway to his death,but unexpectedly <entidade "Sandor Clegane">Sandor Clegane</entidade> dabs the blood off her lip with a handkerchief and after <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> leaves,tells her to give him what he wants.

<entidade "Lancel">Lancel</entidade> and <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade>.
<entidade "Cersei Lannister">Cersei Lannister</entidade> has taken a new lover,her cousin <entidade "Lancel">Lancel</entidade> who was <entidade "King Robert">King Robert</entidade>'s squire.
She also receives a letter informing her of <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade>'s capture.
<entidade "Lancel">Lancel</entidade> is naked in <entidade "Cersei Lannister">Cersei</entidade>'s bedroom.
The thought of being at war is exciting to him,as he has just been made a new young knight.
He asks for the news of the war and asks what their next move is,but <entidade "Cersei Lannister">Cersei</entidade> tells him to shut up and get back in bed.
<entidade "Pycelle">Grand Maester Pycelle</entidade> takes the prostitute <entidade "Ros">Ros</entidade> to bed,revealing that he is actually far less frail than he appears.
He boasts to <entidade "Ros">Ros</entidade> of the several great kings he has served,lamenting first how <entidade "Aerys Targaryen">Aerys Targaryen</entidade> devolved from a charming young man into a paranoid lunatic obsessed with fire,how <entidade "Robert Baratheon">Robert Baratheon</entidade> was a great soldier,but perhaps not so ideal a king,before displaying his sycophantic loyalty to <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade>.

Yoren and <entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade>.
<entidade "Yoren">Yoren</entidade> has assembled a band of new recruits for the <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade>.
Pretending that <entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade> is a boy called <entidade "Arry">Arry</entidade>,he has her join the group.
Also in the group are <entidade "Hot Pie">Hot Pie</entidade>,<entidade "Lommy Greenhands">Lommy Greenhands</entidade>,and <entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade>,who unknown to him,is <entidade "King Robert">King Robert</entidade>'s bastard son.
He had been working for <entidade "Tobho Mott">Tobho Mott</entidade>,but with <entidade "Robert Baratheon">Robert</entidade> dead,the secret funds being sent to <entidade "Mott">Mott</entidade> stopped,so he fired <entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade> and told him he had to join the <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade>.
<entidade "Hot Pie">Hot Pie</entidade> and <entidade "Lommy Greenhands">Lommy</entidade> try to bully <entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade> into giving up <entidade "Needle">Needle</entidade>,but she angrily draws the sword,warning that she has already killed one fat boy and will happily do it again.
<entidade "Gendry">Gendry</entidade> breaks up the argument by taking <entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade>'s side,threatening the boys with violence to keep them from picking on <entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade> later.
Yoren now has to get them all to the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade>,a thousand leagues away,through the war-torn <entidade "Riverlands">Riverlands</entidade>.
They set out.
In the <entidade "North">North</entidade> 
At <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade>,<entidade "Bran">Bran</entidade> has another dream of the three-eyed raven.
He wakes up and tells Osha about how the dream always ends with the bird flying into the crypts under the castle,and he tells her he thinks his father is in the tombs.
<entidade "Osha">Osha</entidade> takes <entidade "Bran">Bran</entidade> down there,and <entidade "Bran">Bran</entidade> tells her about the histories of some of the ancestors entombed there.
They are then surprised by <entidade "Shaggydog">Shaggydog</entidade>,<entidade "Rickon">Rickon</entidade>'s direwolf,who leaps out at them from the empty future tomb of <entidade "Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</entidade>.
<entidade "Rickon">Rickon</entidade> calls <entidade "Shaggydog">Shaggydog</entidade> off,then reveals to Bran that he had the same dream.
Making their way out,<entidade "Osha">Osha</entidade> is still trying to tell <entidade "Bran">Bran</entidade> that it could be a coincidence,but outside they see <entidade "Luwin">Maester Luwin</entidade>,who holds a letter and looks at them with such sadness that it is obviously the news of <entidade "Eddard Stark">Eddard</entidade>'s death.

In the Riverlands 
<entidade "Catelyn">Catelyn</entidade> comforts her son,promising to avenge <entidade "Eddard Stark">Eddard</entidade>'s death At <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>'s camp,<entidade "Catelyn">Catelyn</entidade> stoically walks through the encampment and receives the condolences and respect of the northern bannermen,who bow to her as she passes.
She makes her way into the woods around the camp.
Once she is out of everyone's sight,she breaks down,practically hyperventilating with grief.
Hearing something from deeper in the woods,she finds Robb hacking his sword at a tree in anger and grief.
Lady <entidade "Catelyn">Catelyn</entidade> calls to him and tells him he is ruining his sword.
<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> drops the sword and falls into her arms,vowing to kill the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade> who murdered his father.
<entidade "Catelyn">Catelyn</entidade> comforts him and promises him revenge,but only after they rescue <entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> and <entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade> first.
At <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>'s camp,<entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade> and his bannermen debate what to do in the war against <entidade "King Joffrey">King Joffrey</entidade>.
They debate whether to align with <entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade> or <entidade "Renly Baratheon">Renly Baratheon</entidade>,but there is no agreement as <entidade "Renly Baratheon">Renly</entidade> has greater forces,but <entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade> is elder and next in line of succession ( if <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade>'s children are discounted ).
<entidade "Jon Umber">Jon Umber</entidade> becomes irritated and questions why the northerners should be told what to do by rulers in the south at all,reminding them that the <entidade "North">North</entidade> was once independent of the other Kingdoms before the Targaryens threatened them with their dragons.
With the dragons gone,<entidade "Umber">Umber</entidade> declares there is only one king worthy of his respect and allegiance and bows before <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>,calling out,The <entidade "King Robert">King</entidade> in the North ! 
The other northern bannermen take up the cry and bow before the new King in the North,swearing fealty to <entidade "Robb">Robb</entidade>.
<entidade "Catelyn">Catelyn</entidade> visits the captive <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</entidade> who taunts her about <entidade "Ned">Ned</entidade>'s death and offers to serve her as a lover.
She hits him in the head with a rock.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> says that if she keeps hitting him,she can kill him and that he doesn't fear death,though <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> probably realizes that the <entidade "Starks">Starks</entidade> won't kill him as long as his sister holds <entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> and <entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade> hostage.
<entidade "Catelyn">Catelyn</entidade> tells him he has violated the laws of man and gods,and he asks where <entidade "Ned">Ned</entidade>'s gods were when his head was cut off ( he questions the existence of all gods,the <entidade "Old">Old</entidade> and the <entidade "New">New</entidade> ).
She says injustice in the world is because of men like him.
<entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> responds,There are no men like me,only me.
He admits to pushing <entidade "Bran">Bran</entidade> from the tower,but doesn't reveal why.
At the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannister</entidade> camp,<entidade "Tywin">Lord Tywin</entidade> is holding a strategy meeting with his generals,and is furious that <entidade "Jaime Lannister">Jaime</entidade> has been captured by the <entidade "Starks">Starks</entidade>.
Both <entidade "Stannis">Stannis</entidade> and Renly have claimed the <entidade "Iron Throne">Iron Throne</entidade>,meaning the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade> are now faced with fighting a two-front war against the <entidade "Starks">Starks</entidade> to the north and the <entidade "Baratheons">Baratheons</entidade> to the south.
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade>'s commanders are uncertain what to do,arguing about whether to strike while they still can,fall back and raise reinforcement armies,or sue for peace.
Tyrion points out that any chance of negotiating with <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb Stark</entidade> died when his father <entidade "Eddard Stark">Eddard</entidade> was executed.
The <entidade "Lannisters">Lannister</entidade> army is now exposed,so <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> decides to retreat to <entidade "Harrenhal">Harrenhal</entidade>,the great castle on the northern shores of <entidade "Gods Eye">Gods Eye</entidade>,and use it as a base of operations.
Reluctantly impressed by <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade>'s astute judgment of the situation,<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> orders his son to go to <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade> and serve as <entidade "Acting Hand of the King">Acting Hand of the King</entidade> in <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade>'s stead.
He is to bring <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> and <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> to heel and prevent the young king from making more idiotic mistakes.
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> also tells him to deal with <entidade "Baelish">Baelish</entidade>,<entidade "Varys">Varys</entidade>,and <entidade "Pycelle">Pycelle</entidade> if he gets so much as a hint of treachery from any of them.
He also orders <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> to leave his whore behind.
Later on in his tent,<entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> complains about his father to <entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade>,then decides to defy <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> and take <entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade> to court anyway.

At the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> 
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Snow</entidade> learns of his father's death.
He saddles a horse and prepares to leave to join <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade>'s army,ignoring <entidade "Samwell">Samwell</entidade>'s pleas to stay and fulfill his oaths.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> leaves <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade>,but is pursued.
One of his pursuers hits a tree branch and is unhorsed,and <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> realizes it was <entidade "Samwell">Sam</entidade>.
He turns back to help him.
The other riders are <entidade "Grenn">Grenn</entidade> and <entidade "Pypar">Pypar</entidade>.
He tells them to go back or they will get in trouble too,but they say they can't go back without him.
They surround him and recite their oath to the <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade>,and <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> realizes they are right : leaving would make him a deserter and oathbreaker,something his father would never countenance if he were alive,and <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> doesn't even know if <entidade "Robb Stark">Robb</entidade> would accept his help or turn him over to the authorities.
He agrees to return to the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> with them.
<entidade "Jeor Mormont">Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</entidade> decides to overlook <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade>'s brief desertion,saying many have fled the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade>,only to think better of it and return.
If they executed everyone who did that,they'd have no men left.
<entidade "Mormont">Mormont</entidade> tells <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> that the war between the <entidade "Lannisters">Lannisters</entidade> and <entidade "Starks">Starks</entidade> is less important than what they face now,a renewed threat from the wildlings,<entidade "White">White</entidade> <entidade "Walkers">Walkers</entidade>,and wights.
<entidade "Mormont">Mormont</entidade> means to lead the <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade> in force into the <entidade "Haunted Forest">Haunted Forest</entidade> to learn more of their foe,to prepare to battle against them,and to find the missing <entidade "Benjen Stark">Benjen Stark</entidade>.
<entidade "Jon Snow">Jon</entidade> agrees to commit himself fully to the <entidade "Night's Watch">Night's Watch</entidade> and all that lies ahead.

Across the <entidade "Narrow Sea">Narrow Sea</entidade> 
<entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> regains consciousness.
In the wastelands beyond <entidade "Lhazar">Lhazar</entidade>,<entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> wakes up to terrible news from <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Ser Jorah Mormont</entidade>.
Her son,<entidade "Rhaego">Rhaego</entidade>,is dead.
He was born dead and deformed,covered with scales.
The majority of the khalasar has also moved on,leaving them behind.
However,<entidade "Drogo">Drogo</entidade> lives.
<entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> insists on seeing her husband,and finds him a catatonic vegetable.
<entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> demands to know why,and <entidade "Mirri Maz Duur">Mirri Maz Duur</entidade> explains that when <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> saved her,she had already been raped three times and the temple she served had been burned and defiled by the <entidade "Dothraki">Dothraki</entidade>.
They had sacked her village,looted all they owned,and those not killed were enslaved.
She has now gotten her revenge,not only on <entidade "Drogo">Drogo</entidade>,but on <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade>' child <entidade "Rhaego">Rhaego</entidade> ; now her Stallion Who Mounts the <entidade "World">World</entidade> can burn no cities and slaughter no innocents.
<entidade "Duur">Duur</entidade> agrees that <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> saved her life,but she says to ask <entidade "Drogo">Drogo</entidade> what life is worth when all else is gone.
It is night,and <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> is in their tent tending to <entidade "Drogo">Drogo</entidade>.
She baths him,talks to him,even tries to seduce him,but nothing she does reaches him.
She realizes he is no longer there,and seeing him in his vegetative state breaks her heart.
<entidade "Crying">Crying</entidade>,<entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> kisses him goodbye,then smothers him with a pillow.
Daenerys and her small retinue prepare a funeral pyre for <entidade "Drogo">Drogo</entidade>.
She makes a speech to the few who are left saying that if they wish to go they may,but if they stay with her she will lead them into a glorious future.
She frees those of them who are slaves and asks that they stay as equals.
The maegi smirks as some people begin walking away.
At <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade>' command,<entidade "Rakharo">Rakharo</entidade> places the dragon eggs on the pyre,and <entidade "Mirri Maz Duur">Mirri Maz Duur</entidade> is tied to a stake next to the pyre as well.
She tells <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> that she will not scream while she is burned alive.
<entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> replies that she only wants the maegi's life.
<entidade "Jorah Mormont">Ser Jorah</entidade> believes that <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> intends to kill herself and pleads for her to reconsider,as they can sell the eggs and travel far away.
Ignoring <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade>'s pleas,she kisses his cheek,and sets the pyre alight.
<entidade "Mirri Maz Duur">Mirri Maz Duur</entidade> does indeed scream as she burns,and <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> calmly walks into the flames.
She stands below the pyre as flames appear to consume her.
At dawn,the fire dies down.
<entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> and the rest of the khalasar awake to find <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> sitting among the still smoldering embers,with three newly-hatched baby dragons crawling over her.
Her clothes have burnt away and her body is covered in ash,but she is completely unharmed.
One dragon nuzzles in her arm,another climbs her leg,and the third pulls itself up to sit on her shoulder.
At the sight of the mythical animals born anew,an amazed <entidade "Jorah Mormont">Jorah</entidade> and the few remaining <entidade "Dothraki">Dothraki</entidade> kneel and swear their allegiance to the <entidade "Mother of Dragons">Mother of Dragons</entidade>.
After she slowly stands up from the ashes,the black hatchling on her shoulder rises,spreads its wings and screams,announcing the return of dragons to the world.
