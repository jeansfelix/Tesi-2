He also sees a stableboy that he realizes is a young <entidade "Hodor">Hodor</entidade> - and is surprised that in his youth he was not a lackwit but was intellectually normal and could talk,and his real name is actually <entidade "Wylis">Wylis</entidade>.
Though <entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> wants to stay,he is dragged out of the vision by the <entidade "Three-Eyed Raven">Three-Eyed Raven</entidade>,who warns him that it is dangerous to stay too long in such visions.
Outside the tree,<entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> finds <entidade "Meera Reed">Meera Reed</entidade>,who still appears to be in mourning over her brother's death.
Though <entidade "Meera Reed">Meera</entidade> questions the point of her presence during <entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade>'s training,<entidade "Leaf">Leaf</entidade> states that <entidade "Bran Stark">Bran</entidade> will need her when he leaves the tree.

At <entidade "King's Landing">King</entidade>'s Landing 
In a tavern,a man drunkenly boasts of having taunted <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> during her walk of atonement to the great amusement of the other patrons.
After he finishes his story,he leaves the tavern to urinate against a wall outside.
As he is urinating,he is confronted by <entidade "Gregor Clegane">Ser Gregor Clegane</entidade>,who kills him by smashing his head against the wall.
<entidade "Gregor Clegane">Ser Gregor</entidade> returns to <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade>'s side following the murder.
<entidade "Myrcella">Myrcella</entidade>'s funeral is held at the <entidade "Great Sept of Baelor">Great Sept of Baelor</entidade> but <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> can not attend.
<entidade "Tommen">Tommen</entidade> has ordered that <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> be confined to the <entidade "Red Keep">Red Keep</entidade> since he is concerned that the <entidade "Faith Militant">Faith Militant</entidade> will re-arrest her if she steps inside the sept.
In the sept,<entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> and <entidade "Tommen">Tommen</entidade> talk about <entidade "Myrcella">Myrcella</entidade> and <entidade "Trystane">Prince Trystane</entidade>.
<entidade "Tommen">Tommen</entidade> believes that <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> is to blame for <entidade "Trystane">Prince Trystane</entidade>'s death but tells <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> that he isn't upset with her.
<entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> convinces <entidade "Tommen">Tommen</entidade> to go see his mother and apologize to her as the <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade> enters the sept. After <entidade "Tommen">Tommen</entidade> leaves,<entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> begins threatening the <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade> and asks him why <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> is being punished for her sins,but he isn't,considering he murdered the king he vowed to protect.
As <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> is about to kill the <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade>,the <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade> seems to be unafraid to die,which confuses <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade>.
The <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade> explains that if <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> chooses to kill him then many of the sparrows will die fighting him,but it wouldn't really matter since they have no names or individual power.
He says that they mean nothing individually,but together they can overthrow an empire.
<entidade "Tommen">Tommen</entidade> visits Cersei in the Red Keep and apologizes for not being more assertive during her imprisonment.
He regrets letting the <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade> lock her away and says that he should have torn the sept down with the <entidade "High Sparrow">High Sparrow</entidade> inside of it.
He tells her that he needs her help in being a strong ruler.
<entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> remains uncharacteristically silent throughout the exchange,but when <entidade "Tommen">Tommen</entidade> is done speaking,she embraces him.

In <entidade "Meereen">Meereen</entidade> 
<entidade "Missandei">Missandei</entidade> and <entidade "Grey Worm">Grey Worm</entidade> tell Tyrion that Rhaegal and <entidade "Viserion">Viserion</entidade> have not been eating ever since <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> left.
Tyrion explains that dragons do not do well in captivity and they will probably start eating again if they are unchained.
He also suggests that dragons are intelligent enough to remember their friends,and that they will probably not harm <entidade "Missandei">Missandei</entidade> if they meet her again,since she spent so much time with them when they were little.
Tyrion and <entidade "Varys">Varys</entidade> go down below the pyramid,with <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> advancing into the darkness alone.
One of the dragons emerges from the shadows and <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> maintains eye contact.
When the other emerges,<entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> puts down his torch and gently advances.
To calm them,<entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> speaks gently,explaining that some say that dragons are more intelligent than humans,and tells about about a time when he was little and had asked his uncle for a dragon not even a large one,just a little one like him.
They all laughed,then <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade>'s father told him dragons were extinct,and <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> says he cried himself to sleep that night.
At this point,<entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> is finally close enough to release the locking pin on the second dragon's collar.
The other advances on him,then gingerly turns his head to the side so <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> can free him as well.
The dragons retreat,and <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> hastily returns to <entidade "Varys">Varys</entidade>.
Tyrion instructs <entidade "Varys">Varys</entidade> to punch him if he ever suggests doing anything like that again.

In <entidade "Braavos">Braavos</entidade> 
Still a beggar on the streets,<entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade> is again approached by the <entidade "Waif">Waif</entidade>,who asks her name.
<entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade> says she is no one,at which the <entidade "Waif">Waif</entidade> hits her.
The <entidade "Waif">Waif</entidade> retorts that she doesn't believe that and neither does <entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade>.
She tries to fight back,but the <entidade "Waif">Waif</entidade> vanishes,replaced with <entidade "Jaqen H'ghar">Jaqen H'ghar</entidade>.
He promises that if she says her name,<entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade> will sleep under a roof that night,that she will eat,and he will restore her eyes.
Each time however <entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade> says she has no name.
<entidade "Satisfied">Satisfied</entidade>,he tells <entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade> to follow him,and that she is a beggar no more.

In the <entidade "North">North</entidade> 
At <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade>,<entidade "Ramsay">Ramsay</entidade> and <entidade "Roose">Roose</entidade> discuss plans with <entidade "Harald Karstark">Harald Karstark</entidade> regarding what to do about <entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade>.
After <entidade "Ramsay">Ramsay</entidade> suggests storming <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade>,<entidade "Roose">Roose</entidade> warns <entidade "Ramsay">Ramsay</entidade> that such an action would turn the entire North against House Bolton,adding that if he does not act more sensibly he will be discarded.
At that point,<entidade "Wolkan">Maester Wolkan</entidade> enters and announces that <entidade "Roose">Roose</entidade>'s wife,<entidade "Walda">Walda</entidade>,has given birth to a baby boy.
<entidade "Ramsay">Ramsay</entidade>,realizing that his position is weaker than ever,stabs his father to death and,in his position as the new <entidade "Bolton">Lord Bolton</entidade>,he personally feeds <entidade "Walda">Walda</entidade> and his half-brother to the hounds.
In the woods,<entidade "Brienne">Brienne</entidade> fills <entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> in on her encounter with <entidade "Arya">Arya</entidade>,whilst <entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> is reluctant to talk about her experiences under <entidade "Ramsay Bolton">Ramsay Bolton</entidade>'s tyranny at <entidade "Winterfell">Winterfell</entidade>.
She admits that she ought to have accepted her help sooner.
Then <entidade "Theon">Theon</entidade>,wracked with guilt over his betrayal of the <entidade "Stark">Stark</entidade> family,decides to leave the group and go home.
He tells Sansa that Brienne and <entidade "Pod">Pod</entidade> will do a better job of looking after her,though he tearfully states that he would have gone with her all the way to <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade> if necessary.
He asks to take one of the horses with him,and the two share an embrace.

In the <entidade "Iron Islands">Iron Islands</entidade> 
At <entidade "Pyke">Pyke</entidade>,it is a dark and stormy night.
<entidade "Yara Greyjoy">Yara Greyjoy</entidade> reads a letter to <entidade "King Balon Greyjoy">King Balon Greyjoy</entidade> about how Glovers retook <entidade "Deepwood Motte">Deepwood Motte</entidade> and killed all of the <entidade "Ironborn">Ironborn</entidade> who held the castle.
Yara notes that their invasion is now a definite failure since <entidade "Deepwood Motte">Deepwood Motte</entidade> was the last stronghold that the <entidade "Ironborn">Ironborn</entidade> held in the <entidade "North">North</entidade>.
<entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade> tells her that they will continue fighting,but <entidade "Yara Greyjoy">Yara</entidade> argues that invading the <entidade "North">North</entidade> is pointless since they are unable to hold the strongholds they conquer against the mainland armies and the strongholds in the mainlands aren't really valuable to the <entidade "Ironborn">Ironborn</entidade> because they are so far away from the sea.
<entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade> says that one of the reasons that the invasion wasn't successful was because <entidade "Yara Greyjoy">Yara</entidade> wasted men when she attempted to rescue <entidade "Theon">Theon</entidade>,which she says she will not apologize for.
Yara continues to try to convince <entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade> to end the rebellion,saying the only reason they were able to take strongholds in the <entidade "North">North</entidade> in the first place was because the <entidade "Northerners">Northerners</entidade> were in the south fighting a war,and now that war is over.
She reminds <entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade> that the last time they provoked the <entidade "Northerners">Northerners</entidade> too far they were crushed and her two oldest brothers were killed.
<entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade> tells her that when she rules she can be content with their current standing,but for now she needs to obey his commands or he will make another heir who will.
<entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade> starts walking on the swinging rope bridge that separates two of the towers of <entidade "Pyke">Pyke</entidade>.
Through the storm,he sees a man standing on the bridge who is blocking his way.
He tells the man to get out of the way,but the man reveals himself to be <entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade>'s younger brother,<entidade "Euron Greyjoy">Euron Greyjoy</entidade>.
<entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade> tells him that he's surprised that he's still alive,and <entidade "Euron Greyjoy">Euron</entidade> mocks the <entidade "Drowned God">Drowned God</entidade>,telling <entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade> that he is the <entidade "Drowned God">Drowned God</entidade>.
<entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade> explains that he heard a rumor that <entidade "Euron Greyjoy">Euron</entidade> lost his senses during a storm and his crew had to tie him to the mast of the ship to prevent him from jumping overboard.
<entidade "Euron Greyjoy">Euron</entidade> doesn't deny the rumor,and explains to Balon that he cut the tongues out of all of his crew members because he wanted silence.
<entidade "Euron Greyjoy">Euron</entidade> then says that <entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade> is too old to rule and that he's been ruling long enough and it's someone else's turn.
<entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade> tells <entidade "Euron Greyjoy">Euron</entidade> that he isn't a true <entidade "Ironborn">Ironborn</entidade> because he lost his wits during a thunderstorm and tries to stab him,but <entidade "Euron Greyjoy">Euron</entidade> throws him off the rope bridge to his death.
At <entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade>'s funeral,<entidade "Yara Greyjoy">Yara</entidade> tells the priest,<entidade "Aeron Greyjoy">Aeron Greyjoy</entidade>,<entidade "Balon">Balon</entidade>'s youngest brother,that she will find the person who did this and feed them to sharks while they're still alive.
She swears to do this upon the <entidade "Salt Throne">Salt Throne</entidade> and <entidade "Aeron Greyjoy">Aeron</entidade> explains to her that she isn't the ruler yet,because the law says that the <entidade "Kingsmoot">Kingsmoot</entidade> chooses the next ruler.
<entidade "Yara Greyjoy">Yara</entidade> argues that her father wanted her to rule,but <entidade "Aeron Greyjoy">Aeron</entidade> says that he doesn't make the law.

At the <entidade "Wall">Wall</entidade> 
At <entidade "Castle Black">Castle Black</entidade>,nightfall has arrived and the band of black brothers loyal to <entidade "Jon">Jon</entidade> have not yet surrendered.
When <entidade "Davos">Davos</entidade> refuses a final ultimatum from <entidade "Alliser Thorne">Ser Alliser Thorne</entidade>,the acting <entidade "Commander">Lord Commander</entidade> orders the door to be battered down with a sledgehammer.
Before the mutineers can break in,however,<entidade "Edd">Edd</entidade> returns with <entidade "Tormund Giantsbane">Tormund Giantsbane</entidade> and an army of wildlings.
Though <entidade "Thorne">Thorne</entidade> demands that the watchmen stand and fight,they are intimidated into surrender by the giant,<entidade "Wun Wun">Wun Wun</entidade>,enabling an almost bloodless takeover.
One archer shoots an arrow into <entidade "Wun Wun">Wun Wun</entidade>'s back,which has no effect upon the giant other than to cause <entidade "Wun Wun">Wun Wun</entidade> to grab the archer off his perch and smash his skull against a wall.
The watchmen,seeing this,quickly throw down their arms and surrender.
No wildlings are hurt.
<entidade "Thorne">Thorne</entidade>,plus Olly and the officers who mutinied alongside him,are led away to the <entidade "Ice Cells">Ice Cells</entidade>.
As <entidade "Tormund Giantsbane">Tormund</entidade> inspects <entidade "Jon">Jon</entidade>'s corpse,<entidade "Davos">Davos</entidade> visits <entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade>,who has donned her normal glamor but is still gripped by a crisis of faith.
When he asks her if reviving <entidade "Jon">Jon</entidade> is possible,she admits to having seen it done,but insists that she can not do it,having lost faith in the <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade> due to the failure of her predictions regarding <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</entidade> to come true.
After <entidade "Davos">Davos</entidade> implores her simply to try,she agrees.
After washing <entidade "Jon">Jon</entidade>'s wounds clean and burning his hair,she attempts to revive him using murmured <entidade "High">High</entidade> Valyrian incantations,but it seems they have no effect.
After a moment,<entidade "Tormund Giantsbane">Tormund</entidade> leaves,and <entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> offers a final please in the <entidade "Common Tongue">Common Tongue</entidade>,but leaves the room,despondent.
<entidade "Edd">Edd</entidade> and finally <entidade "Davos">Davos</entidade> follow her a moment later.
Once the room is empty however,<entidade "Ghost">Ghost</entidade>,who had been sleeping underneath the table upon which <entidade "Jon">Jon</entidade> was lying,perks up,and <entidade "Jon">Jon</entidade> suddenly awakens,gasping for air.
