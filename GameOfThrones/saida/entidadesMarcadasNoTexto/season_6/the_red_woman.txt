They take the body inside where <entidade "Edd">Edd</entidade> clears a table and angrily curses Thorne after closing <entidade "Jon">Jon</entidade>'s eyes.

<entidade "Davos">Davos</entidade> responds they are hopelessly outnumbered,stating <entidade "Ghost">Ghost</entidade> isn't enough when <entidade "Edd">Edd</entidade> brings him up,before reminding them there are others nearby who owe <entidade "Jon">Jon</entidade> their lives.
Realizing he means the <entidade "Wildlings">Wildlings</entidade>,<entidade "Edd">Edd</entidade> instructs them to bar the door and not let anyone in while he sneaks out to get help.
All members of the <entidade "Watch">Watch</entidade> are shown bearing arms toward the room where <entidade "Jon">Jon</entidade>'s body is being guarded by <entidade "Davos">Ser Davos</entidade> and the men loyal to <entidade "Jon Snow">Jon Snow</entidade>.

To <entidade "Davos">Ser Davos</entidade> he offers a fresh horse and safe passage to ride south or in any direction he wishes,and that he can take <entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> with him.
<entidade "Davos">Ser Davos</entidade> mocks what he knows to be an insincere offer by requesting mutton.
<entidade "Davos">Ser Davos</entidade> tells <entidade "Thorne">Thorne</entidade> he is a poor hunter and does not want to starve,so he needs some mutton for his trip.
Thorne promises him food will be provided.
<entidade "Thorne">Ser Thorne</entidade> says the offer is available as long as everyone in the room surrenders,and does so by sundown.

Melisandre without her magical glamor of youth.
Alone in her bedroom,<entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade> appears despondent and looking as if she has been betrayed or led astray by The <entidade "Lord of Light">Lord of Light</entidade>.
On a table next to her bed are various containers,some small that contain potions and other liquids.
She unbuttons the front of her dress showing a young beautiful body.
She then removes the dress completely and stands nude before a mirror.
When she removes her large necklace the gem loses its glow.
In the mirror,<entidade "Melisandre">Melisandre</entidade>'s reflections shows she has transformed or morphed back to a 400-year-old woman she has been said to be,a frail old woman with sagging breasts,leathery skin and thin wispy white hair.
Fully nude,with her head bowed down in a despondent manner,she slowly climbs into bed and pulls the fur blanket on top of her.
