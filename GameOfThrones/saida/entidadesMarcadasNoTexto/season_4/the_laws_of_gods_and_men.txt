At <entidade "King">King</entidade>'s Landing 
At a meeting of the <entidade "Small Council">Small Council</entidade>,<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> informs the councilors that <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade>'s trial will begin that afternoon.

In the dungeon,<entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> has <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> shackled and brought into the throne room to begin his trial.

Several witnesses are called for the prosecution,including <entidade "Meryn Trant">Ser Meryn Trant</entidade>,<entidade "Pycelle">Grand Maester Pycelle</entidade>,<entidade "Regent Cersei">Queen Regent Cersei</entidade>,and <entidade "Varys">Varys</entidade>,all of whom give testimony backing the accusations against <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade>.

Varys testifies at <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade>'s trial 
At recess,<entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> asks <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> to spare <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade>,offering to break his oath to the <entidade "Kingsguard">Kingsguard</entidade> and return to <entidade "Casterly Rock">Casterly Rock</entidade>,to be his heir.

Before the recess ends,<entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> speaks with <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> and urges him to do so.
Tyrion is deeply distrustful of the offer,remarking that <entidade "Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</entidade> was promised the same thing and yet still lost his head,but <entidade "Jaime">Jaime</entidade> pleads with his brother to trust him,insisting that their father will keep his word.
Returning to the trial,<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> orders the next witness to testify : <entidade "Shae">Shae</entidade>.
She testifies that <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> planned <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade>'s murder together,claiming that <entidade "Sansa">Sansa</entidade> wanted vengeance for the murder of her father,mother,and brother.
She tells the judges of <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade>'s sexual desires,embarrassing him in front of the crowd.
Before she can continue,<entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade>,enraged beyond sense,angrily demands that he be allowed to confess his crimes.
He angrily roars about how he saved <entidade "Kingsguard">King</entidade>'s Landing from <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</entidade>'s forces and says he should've allowed <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> to kill everyone in <entidade "King's Landing">King's Landing</entidade>,much to the horror and disgust of the people in the court.
Tyrion then claims to be guilty.
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> assumes that he is guilty for murdering <entidade "King Joffrey Baratheon">King Joffrey Baratheon</entidade>.
Tyrion denies this,saying he is guilty of a far more monstrous crime.
I am guilty of being a dwarf ! 
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> scoffs at <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade>'s claims and says he is not on trial for being a dwarf.
<entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> angrily says he has been on trial for his entire life as a dwarf.
<entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> asks if he has nothing to say in his defense.
Tyrion then says he has nothing to say in his defense but only this.
He then reveals his true feelings about <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade>,denying guilt in the king's murder but saying he wished to have killed <entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade> himself.
Tyrion then turns his full fury towards <entidade "Cersei">Cersei</entidade> and says that watching her vicious bastard of a son die gave him more relief than a thousand lying whores.
He then turns around to the court and roars that he wishes to have become the monster they thought he was and would have gladly give his life to watch everyone die from drinking poison.
This enrages everyone in the court and <entidade "Tywin">Tywin</entidade> orders <entidade "Meryn Trant">Ser Meryn</entidade> to escort <entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> back to the dungeons.
Before he can be escorted out,<entidade "Tyrion">Tyrion</entidade> bellows that he will not lose his life for a crime he did not commit and,knowing that he will get no justice from the court,demands a trial by combat. 

In <entidade "Braavos">Braavos</entidade> 
<entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis Baratheon</entidade> and Ser Davos visit the Iron Bank of <entidade "Braavos">Braavos</entidade> in hopes of securing funds to aid <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade>' war effort.
At first <entidade "Tycho Nestoris">Tycho Nestoris</entidade>,a representative from the bank,rejects their request,but <entidade "Davos">Davos</entidade> entreats him and points out that funding <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade> is the best way they could possibly get the gold they loaned to <entidade "Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</entidade> back.
The <entidade "Bank">Bank</entidade> agrees to lend them gold,and <entidade "Davos">Davos</entidade> uses it to once again recruit his old pirate friend <entidade "Salladhor Saan">Salladhor Saan</entidade> to <entidade "Stannis Baratheon">Stannis</entidade>' cause.

In <entidade "Meereen">Meereen</entidade> 
<entidade "Drogon">Drogon</entidade> toasting goats On one sunny day outside of <entidade "Meereen">Meereen</entidade>,a goat herder and his son are peacefully tending the goats on a hill while the son throws rocks to pass the time.
Suddenly,<entidade "Drogon">Drogon</entidade> ( now the size of a horse ) appears and burns the field and kills a flock of goats while taking one with him.
The goat herder travels to <entidade "Meereen">Meereen</entidade> to visit the queen and lays the charred remains of his flock before <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade>,hoping to not anger the queen and believes it to be punishment.
<entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> apologizes about <entidade "Drogon">Drogon</entidade>'s actions and promises to pay back three times the worth of his flock. 
After he departs,<entidade "Hizdahr zo Loraq">Hizdahr zo Loraq</entidade> presents his petition : the right to bury his father's remains in the <entidade "Temple of the Graces">Temple of the Graces</entidade>,as he was one of the <entidade "Meereenese Great Masters">Meereenese Great Masters</entidade> crucified on <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade>'s orders.
She counters that he was one of the masters that crucified the 163 children.
<entidade "Loraq">Loraq</entidade> reveals that his father actually spoke out against the crucifixion of the slave children but was overruled,but later was killed due to <entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade>'s judgment anyway.
Somewhat mollified,<entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> allows him to bury his father.
As he leaves,<entidade "Daenerys">Daenerys</entidade> asks how many more supplicants are waiting ; <entidade "Missandei">Missandei</entidade> answers that there are over 200 more.
