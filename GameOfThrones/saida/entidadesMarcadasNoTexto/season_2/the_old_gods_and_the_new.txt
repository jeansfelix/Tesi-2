<entidade "Joffrey">Joffrey</entidade>,still manically cursing the mob and demanding they all be killed,shrieks that Tyrion can not speak to him in that way and petulantly reminds his uncle that he is talking to a king.

<entidade "Outside">Outside</entidade>,<entidade "Sansa Stark">Sansa</entidade> is dragged away by a mob of angry men and is about to be raped,when <entidade "Sandor">Sandor</entidade> The <entidade "Hound Clegane">Hound Clegane</entidade> arrives and slays her assailants.
