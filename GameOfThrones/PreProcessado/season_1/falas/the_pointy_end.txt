Syrio Forel: "I am Syrio Forel, and you will be speaking to me with more respect."

Syrio: "The First Sword of Braavos does not run."
Syrio: "What do we say, to the god of death?"
Arya Stark: "Not today."
Syrio: "Go."

Varys: "When you look at me, do you see a hero?"
Varys: "What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learnt the truth about Joffrey's birth?"
Eddard Stark: "The madness of mercy that she might save her children."
Varys: "Ah, the children. It's always the innocents. It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar. The wine slowed him down, and the boar ripped him open, yes, but it was your mercy that killed the King. I trust you know you're a dead man, Lord Eddard."
Eddard: "The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother."
Varys: "The wrong brother, sadly, and lost to her. Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers."
Eddard: "If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it."
Varys: "Not today, my lord."
Eddard: "Tell me something, Varys. Who do you truly serve?"
Varys: "The Realm, my Lord. Someone must."

Robb Stark: "Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his arse kissed?"
Theon Greyjoy: "You afraid?"
Robb: (looks down at his shaking hand) "I must be."
Theon: "Good."
Robb: "Why is that good?"
Theon: "Means you're not stupid."

Bran Stark: "They'll be back soon. Robb will free father, and they'll come back with mother."
Rickon Stark: "No, they won't."

Osha: "I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way. All these swords, they should be going north, boy, north, not south. The cold winds are rising."
Robb: "Tell Lord Tywin, winter is coming for him. Twenty thousand northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold."
Ser Barristan Selmy: "I am a knight. I shall die a knight."
Robb: "My Lord father taught me it was death to bear steel against you liege-Lord. Doubtless, the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Jon Umber: Your meat?! Is bloody tough!
