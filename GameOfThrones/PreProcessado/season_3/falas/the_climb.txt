Ramsay Snow: "So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?"
Theon Greyjoy: "Please!"
Ramsay: "Please is not a body part."
Theon: "I'll tell you everything, please!"
Ramsay: "But you already told me everything, remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you. Now, how about your little finger? You don't need that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that." He loosens the binds on Theon's right hand. "You've been wondering why you're here, haven't you? Where you are, who I am, why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the Old Gods and the New, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you, and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger!"
Theon: "If I win, you'll let me go?"
Ramsay: "If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."
Theon: "Please!"
Ramsay: "You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?"
Theon: "The North."
Ramsay: "Too vague."
Theon: "Deepwood Motte."
Ramsay: "Terrible guess." Theon cries out in pain as Ramsay jams a knife into his finger. "Now where?"
Theon: "Last Hearth?"
Ramsay: "Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?"
Theon: "Aaaah, the Karhold!"
Ramsay: "Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?"
Theon: "No, it was just a guess."
Ramsay: "Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?"
Theon: "Torrhen Karstark."
Ramsay: "He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer."
Theon: "He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark." Ramsay heads back to his chair and sits. "You swore to tell me if I..."
Ramsay: "You're right."
Theon: "Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me."
Ramsay: "Yes. You win." Theon breathes a sigh of relief but then Ramsay springs back up again. "Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar!" He sticks his knife back into Theon's finger and begins to peel away the skin, making him scream again. "I'm afraid I am. Everything I told you is a lie. This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason. I enjoy it."
Theon: "PLEASE! CUT IT OFF, CUT IT OFF, CUT IT OFF! AHHHHHHH!"
Ramsay: "I win."
